tableOfContents: On the art of making up one's mind -- On the disadvantage of not
  getting what one wants -- On the exceptional merit attaching to the things we meant
  to do -- On the preparation and employment of love philtres -- On the delights and
  benefits of slavery -- On the care and management of women -- On the minding of
  other people's business -- On the time wasted in looking before one leaps -- On
  the nobility of ourselves -- On the motherliness of man -- On the inadvisability
  of following advice -- On the playing of marches at the funerals of marionettes.
