ART OF MAKING UP ONE&rsquo;S MIND</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Now</span>, which would you advise,
dear?&nbsp; You see, with the red I shan&rsquo;t be able to wear
my magenta hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, why not have the grey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I think the grey will be <i>more
useful</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good material.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s a <i>pretty</i> grey.&nbsp; You
know what I mean, dear; not a <i>common</i> grey.&nbsp; Of course
grey is always an <i>uninteresting</i> colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then again, what I feel about the red is that it is
so warm-looking.&nbsp; Red makes you <i>feel</i> warm even when
you&rsquo;re <i>not</i> warm.&nbsp; You know what I mean,
dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, why not have the red?&nbsp; It suits
you&mdash;red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; do you really think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when you&rsquo;ve got a colour, I mean, of
course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the drawback to red.&nbsp; No, I think, on
the whole, the grey is <i>safer</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will take the grey, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I&rsquo;d better; don&rsquo;t you,
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it myself very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is good wearing stuff.&nbsp; I shall have it
trimmed with&mdash;&nbsp; Oh! you haven&rsquo;t cut it off, have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just about to, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t for a moment.&nbsp; Just let me have
another look at the red.&nbsp; You see, dear, it has just
occurred to me&mdash;that chinchilla would look so well on the
red!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, you see, I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> the
chinchilla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then have the red.&nbsp; Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is the hat I&rsquo;m thinking
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t anything else you could wear with
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, and it would go so <i>beautifully</i>
with the grey.&mdash;Yes, I think I&rsquo;ll have the grey.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s always a safe colour&mdash;grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen yards I think you said, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, fourteen yards will be enough; because I shall mix
it with&mdash;One minute.&nbsp; You see, dear, if I take the grey
I shall have nothing to wear with my black jacket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it go with grey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not well&mdash;not so well as with red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have the red then.&nbsp; You evidently fancy
it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, personally I prefer the grey.&nbsp; But then one
must think of <i>everything</i>, and&mdash;Good gracious!
that&rsquo;s surely not the right time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam, it&rsquo;s ten minutes slow.&nbsp; We always
keep our clocks a little slow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we were too have been at Madame Jannaway&rsquo;s at
a quarter past twelve.&nbsp; How long shopping does take!&nbsp;
Why, whatever time did we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About eleven, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-past ten.&nbsp; I remember now; because, you know,
we said we&rsquo;d start at half-past nine.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
been two hours already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t seem to have done much, do
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done literally nothing, and I meant to have done so
much.&nbsp; I <i>must</i> go to Madame Jannaway&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Have you got my purse, dear?&nbsp; Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,
I&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now you haven&rsquo;t decided whether
you&rsquo;re going to have the grey or the red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what I <i>do</i> want
now.&nbsp; I had made up my mind a minute ago, and now it&rsquo;s
all gone again&mdash;oh yes, I remember, the red.&nbsp; Yes,
I&rsquo;ll have the red.&nbsp; No, I don&rsquo;t mean the red, I
mean the grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking about the red last time, if you
remember, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so I was, you&rsquo;re quite right.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the worst of shopping.&nbsp; Do you know I get quite
confused sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will decide on the red, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I shan&rsquo;t do any better, shall I,
dear?&nbsp; What do <i>you</i> think?&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t got
any other shades of red, have you?&nbsp; This is such an
<i>ugly</i> red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shopman reminds her that she has seen all the other reds,
and that this is the particular shade she selected and
admired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; she replies, with the air of one
from whom all earthly cares are falling, &ldquo;I must take that
then, I suppose.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be worried about it any
longer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve wasted half the morning
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside she recollects three insuperable objections to the
red, and four unanswerable arguments why she should have selected
the grey.&nbsp; She wonders would they change it, if she went
back and asked to see the shop-walker?&nbsp; Her friend, who
wants her lunch, thinks not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I hate about shopping,&rdquo; she
says.&nbsp; &ldquo;One never has time to really
<i>think</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She says she shan&rsquo;t go to that shop again.</p>
<p>We laugh at her, but are we so very much better?&nbsp; Come,
my superior male friend, have you never stood, amid your
wardrobe, undecided whether, in her eyes, you would appear more
imposing, clad in the rough tweed suit that so admirably displays
your broad shoulders; or in the orthodox black frock, that, after
all, is perhaps more suitable to the figure of a man
approaching&mdash;let us say, the nine-and-twenties?&nbsp; Or,
better still, why not riding costume?&nbsp; Did we not hear her
say how well Jones looked in his top-boots and breeches, and,
&ldquo;hang it all,&rdquo; we have a better leg than Jones.&nbsp;
What a pity riding-breeches are made so baggy nowadays.&nbsp; Why
is it that male fashions tend more and more to hide the male
leg?&nbsp; As women have become less and less ashamed of theirs,
we have become more and more reticent of ours.&nbsp; Why are the
silken hose, the tight-fitting pantaloons, the neat kneebreeches
of our forefathers impossible to-day?&nbsp; Are we grown more
modest&mdash;or has there come about a falling off, rendering
concealment advisable?</p>
<p>I can never understand, myself, why women love us.&nbsp; It
must be our honest worth, our sterling merit, that attracts
them&mdash;certainly not our appearance, in a pair of tweed
&ldquo;dittos,&rdquo; black angora coat and vest, stand-up
collar, and chimney-pot hat!&nbsp; No, it must be our sheer force
of character that compels their admiration.</p>
<p>What a good time our ancestors must have had was borne in upon
me when, on one occasion, I appeared in character at a fancy
dress ball.&nbsp; What I represented I am unable to say, and I
don&rsquo;t particularly care.&nbsp; I only know it was something
military.&nbsp; I also remember that the costume was two sizes
too small for me in the chest, and thereabouts; and three sizes
too large for me in the hat.&nbsp; I padded the hat, and dined in
the middle of the day off a chop and half a glass of
soda-water.&nbsp; I have gained prizes as a boy for mathematics,
also for scripture history&mdash;not often, but I have done
it.&nbsp; A literary critic, now dead, once praised a book of
mine.&nbsp; I know there have been occasions when my conduct has
won the approbation of good men; but never&mdash;never in my
whole life, have I felt more proud, more satisfied with myself
than on that evening when, the last hook fastened, I gazed at my
full-length Self in the cheval glass.&nbsp; I was a dream.&nbsp;
I say it who should not; but I am not the only one who said
it.&nbsp; I was a glittering dream.&nbsp; The groundwork was red,
trimmed with gold braid wherever there was room for gold braid;
and where there was no more possible room for gold braid there
hung gold cords, and tassels, and straps.&nbsp; Gold buttons and
buckles fastened me, gold embroidered belts and sashes caressed
me, white horse-hair plumes waved o&rsquo;er me.&nbsp; I am not
sure that everything was in its proper place, but I managed to
get everything on somehow, and I looked well.&nbsp; It suited
me.&nbsp; My success was a revelation to me of female human
nature.&nbsp; Girls who had hitherto been cold and distant
gathered round me, timidly solicitous of notice.&nbsp; Girls on
whom I smiled lost their heads and gave themselves airs.&nbsp;
Girls who were not introduced to me sulked and were rude to girls
that had been.&nbsp; For one poor child, with whom I sat out two
dances (at least she sat, while I stood gracefully beside
her&mdash;I had been advised, by the costumier, <i>not</i> to
sit), I was sorry.&nbsp; He was a worthy young fellow, the son of
a cotton broker, and he would have made her a good husband, I
feel sure.&nbsp; But he was foolish to come as a beer-bottle.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, it is as well those old fashions have gone
out.&nbsp; A week in that suit might have impaired my natural
modesty.</p>
<p>One wonders that fancy dress balls are not more popular in
this grey age of ours.&nbsp; The childish instinct to
&ldquo;dress up,&rdquo; to &ldquo;make believe,&rdquo; is with us
all.&nbsp; We grow so tired of being always ourselves.&nbsp; A
tea-table discussion, at which I once assisted, fell into
this:&mdash;Would any one of us, when it came to the point,
change with anybody else, the poor man with the millionaire, the
governess with the princess&mdash;change not only outward
circumstances and surroundings, but health and temperament,
heart, brain, and soul; so that not one mental or physical
particle of one&rsquo;s original self one would retain, save only
memory?&nbsp; The general opinion was that we would not, but one
lady maintained the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, you wouldn&rsquo;t really, dear,&rdquo; argued a
friend; &ldquo;you <i>think</i> you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; persisted the first lady; &ldquo;I
am tired of myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d even be you, for a
change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my youth, the question chiefly important to me
was&mdash;What sort of man shall I decide to be?&nbsp; At
nineteen one asks oneself this question; at thirty-nine we say,
&ldquo;I wish Fate hadn&rsquo;t made me this sort of
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In those days I was a reader of much well-meant advice to
young men, and I gathered that, whether I should become a Sir
Lancelot, a Herr Teufelsdrockh, or an Iago was a matter for my
own individual choice.&nbsp; Whether I should go through life
gaily or gravely was a question the pros and cons of which I
carefully considered.&nbsp; For patterns I turned to books.&nbsp;
Byron was then still popular, and many of us made up our minds to
be gloomy, saturnine young men, weary with the world, and prone
to soliloquy.&nbsp; I determined to join them.</p>
<p>For a month I rarely smiled, or, when I did, it was with a
weary, bitter smile, concealing a broken heart&mdash;at least
that was the intention.&nbsp; Shallow-minded observers
misunderstood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know exactly how it feels,&rdquo; they would say,
looking at me sympathetically, &ldquo;I often have it
myself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the sudden change in the weather, I
think;&rdquo; and they would press neat brandy upon me, and
suggest ginger.</p>
<p>Again, it is distressing to the young man, busy burying his
secret sorrow under a mound of silence, to be slapped on the back
by commonplace people and asked&mdash;&ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;s
&lsquo;the hump&rsquo; this morning?&rdquo; and to hear his mood
of dignified melancholy referred to, by those who should know
better, as &ldquo;the sulks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are practical difficulties also in the way of him who
would play the Byronic young gentleman.&nbsp; He must be
supernaturally wicked&mdash;or rather must <i>have been</i>;
only, alas! in the unliterary grammar of life, where the future
tense stands first, and the past is formed, not from the
indefinite, but from the present indicative, &ldquo;to have
been&rdquo; is &ldquo;to be&rdquo;; and to be wicked on a small
income is impossible.&nbsp; The ruin of even the simplest of
maidens costs money.&nbsp; In the Courts of Love one cannot sue
in <i>form&acirc; pauperis</i>; nor would it be the Byronic
method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To drown remembrance in the cup&rdquo; sounds well, but
then the &ldquo;cup,&rdquo; to be fitting, should be of some
expensive brand.&nbsp; To drink deep of old Tokay or Asti is
poetical; but when one&rsquo;s purse necessitates that the
draught, if it is to be deep enough to drown anything, should be
of thin beer at five-and-nine the four and a half gallon cask, or
something similar in price, sin is robbed of its flavour.</p>
<p>Possibly also&mdash;let me think it&mdash;the conviction may
have been within me that Vice, even at its daintiest, is but an
ugly, sordid thing, repulsive in the sunlight; that
though&mdash;as rags and dirt to art&mdash;it may afford
picturesque material to Literature, it is an evil-smelling
garment to the wearer; one that a good man, by reason of poverty
of will, may come down to, but one to be avoided with all
one&rsquo;s effort, discarded with returning mental
prosperity.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, I grew weary of training for a saturnine
young man; and, in the midst of my doubt, I chanced upon a book
the hero of which was a debonnaire young buck, own cousin to Tom
and Jerry.&nbsp; He attended fights, both of cocks and men,
flirted with actresses, wrenched off door-knockers, extinguished
street lamps, played many a merry jest upon many an
unappreciative night watch-man.&nbsp; For all the which he was
much beloved by the women of the book.&nbsp; Why should not I
flirt with actresses, put out street lamps, play pranks on
policemen, and be beloved?&nbsp; London life was changed since
the days of my hero, but much remained, and the heart of woman is
eternal.&nbsp; If no longer prizefighting was to be had, at least
there were boxing competitions, so called, in dingy back parlours
out Whitechapel way.&nbsp; Though cockfighting was a lost sport,
were there not damp cellars near the river where for twopence a
gentleman might back mongrel terriers to kill rats against time,
and feel himself indeed a sportsman?&nbsp; True, the atmosphere
of reckless gaiety, always surrounding my hero, I missed myself
from these scenes, finding in its place an atmosphere more
suggestive of gin, stale tobacco, and nervous apprehension of the
police; but the essentials must have been the same, and the next
morning I could exclaim in the very words of my
prototype&mdash;&ldquo;Odds crickets, but I feel as though the
devil himself were in my head.&nbsp; Peste take me for a
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in this direction likewise my fatal lack of means opposed
me. (It affords much food to the philosophic mind, this influence
of income upon character.)&nbsp; Even fifth-rate &ldquo;boxing
competitions,&rdquo; organized by &ldquo;friendly leads,&rdquo;
and ratting contests in Rotherhithe slums, become expensive, when
you happen to be the only gentleman present possessed of a
collar, and are expected to do the honours of your class in
dog&rsquo;s-nose.&nbsp; True, climbing lamp-posts and putting out
the gas is fairly cheap, providing always you are not caught in
the act, but as a recreation it lacks variety.&nbsp; Nor is the
modern London lamp-post adapted to sport.&nbsp; Anything more
difficult to grip&mdash;anything with less &ldquo;give&rdquo; in
it&mdash;I have rarely clasped.&nbsp; The disgraceful amount of
dirt allowed to accumulate upon it is another drawback from the
climber&rsquo;s point of view.&nbsp; By the time you have swarmed
up your third post a positive distaste for &ldquo;gaiety&rdquo;
steals over you.&nbsp; Your desire is towards arnica and a
bath.</p>
<p>Nor in jokes at the expense of policemen is the fun entirely
on your side.&nbsp; Maybe I did not proceed with judgment.&nbsp;
It occurs to me now, looking back, that the neighbourhoods of
Covent Garden and Great Marlborough Street were ill-chosen for
sport of this nature.&nbsp; To bonnet a fat policeman is
excellent fooling.&nbsp; While he is struggling with his helmet
you can ask him comic questions, and by the time he has got his
head free you are out of sight.&nbsp; But the game should be
played in a district where there is not an average of three
constables to every dozen square yards.&nbsp; When two other
policemen, who have had their eye on you for the past ten
minutes, are watching the proceedings from just round the next
corner, you have little or no leisure for due enjoyment of the
situation.&nbsp; By the time you have run the whole length of
Great Titchfield Street and twice round Oxford Market, you are of
opinion that a joke should never be prolonged beyond the point at
which there is danger of its becoming wearisome; and that the
time has now arrived for home and friends.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Law,&rdquo; on the other hand, now raised by
reinforcements to a strength of six or seven men, is just
beginning to enjoy the chase.&nbsp; You picture to yourself,
while doing Hanover Square, the scene in Court the next
morning.&nbsp; You will be accused of being drunk and
disorderly.&nbsp; It will be idle for you to explain to the
magistrate (or to your relations afterwards) that you were only
trying to live up to a man who did this sort of thing in a book
and was admired for it.&nbsp; You will be fined the usual forty
shillings; and on the next occasion of your calling at the
Mayfields&rsquo; the girls will be out, and Mrs. Mayfield, an
excellent lady, who has always taken a motherly interest in you,
will talk seriously to you and urge you to sign the pledge.</p>
<p>Thanks to your youth and constitution you shake off the
pursuit at Notting Hill; and, to avoid any chance of unpleasant
<i>contretemps</i> on the return journey, walk home to Bloomsbury
by way of Camden Town and Islington.</p>
<p>I abandoned sportive tendencies as the result of a vow made by
myself to Providence, during the early hours of a certain Sunday
morning, while clinging to the waterspout of an unpretentious
house situate in a side street off Soho.&nbsp; I put it to
Providence as man to man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me only get out of
this,&rdquo; I think were the muttered words I used, &ldquo;and
no more &lsquo;sport&rsquo; for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Providence
closed on the offer, and did let me get out of it.&nbsp; True, it
was a complicated &ldquo;get out,&rdquo; involving a broken
skylight and three gas globes, two hours in a coal cellar, and a
sovereign to a potman for the loan of an ulster; and when at
last, secure in my chamber, I took stock of myself&mdash;what was
left of me,&mdash;I could not but reflect that Providence might
have done the job neater.&nbsp; Yet I experienced no desire to
escape the terms of the covenant; my inclining for the future was
towards a life of simplicity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I cast about for a new character, and found one
to suit me.&nbsp; The German professor was becoming popular as a
hero about this period.&nbsp; He wore his hair long and was
otherwise untidy, but he had &ldquo;a heart of steel,&rdquo;
occasionally of gold.&nbsp; The majority of folks in the book,
judging him from his exterior together with his
conversation&mdash;in broken English, dealing chiefly with his
dead mother and his little sister Lisa,&mdash;dubbed him
uninteresting, but then they did not know about the heart.&nbsp;
His chief possession was a lame dog which he had rescued from a
brutal mob; and when he was not talking broken English he was
nursing this dog.</p>
<p>But his speciality was stopping runaway horses, thereby saving
the heroine&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; This, combined with the broken
English and the dog, rendered him irresistible.</p>
<p>He seemed a peaceful, amiable sort of creature, and I decided
to try him.&nbsp; I could not of course be a German professor,
but I could, and did, wear my hair long in spite of much public
advice to the contrary, voiced chiefly by small boys.&nbsp; I
endeavoured to obtain possession of a lame dog, but failed.&nbsp;
A one-eyed dealer in Seven Dials, to whom, as a last resource, I
applied, offered to lame one for me for an extra five shillings,
but this suggestion I declined.&nbsp; I came across an
uncanny-looking mongrel late one night.&nbsp; He was not lame,
but he seemed pretty sick; and, feeling I was not robbing anybody
of anything very valuable, I lured him home and nursed him.&nbsp;
I fancy I must have over-nursed him.&nbsp; He got so healthy in
the end, there was no doing anything with him.&nbsp; He was an
ill-conditioned cur, and he was too old to be taught.&nbsp; He
became the curse of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; His idea of sport
was killing chickens and sneaking rabbits from outside
poulterers&rsquo; shops.&nbsp; For recreation he killed cats and
frightened small children by yelping round their legs.&nbsp;
There were times when I could have lamed him myself, if only I
could have got hold of him.&nbsp; I made nothing by running that
dog&mdash;nothing whatever.&nbsp; People, instead of admiring me
for nursing him back to life, called me a fool, and said that if
I didn&rsquo;t drown the brute they would.&nbsp; He spoilt my
character utterly&mdash;I mean my character at this period.&nbsp;
It is difficult to pose as a young man with a heart of gold, when
discovered in the middle of the road throwing stones at your own
dog.&nbsp; And stones were the only things that would reach and
influence him.</p>
<p>I was also hampered by a scarcity in runaway horses.&nbsp; The
horse of our suburb was not that type of horse.&nbsp; Once and
only once did an opportunity offer itself for practice.&nbsp; It
was a good opportunity, inasmuch as he was not running away very
greatly.&nbsp; Indeed, I doubt if he knew himself that he was
running away.&nbsp; It transpired afterwards that it was a habit
of his, after waiting for his driver outside the Rose and Crown
for what he considered to be a reasonable period, to trot home on
his own account.&nbsp; He passed me going about seven miles an
hour, with the reins dragging conveniently beside him.&nbsp; He
was the very thing for a beginner, and I prepared myself.&nbsp;
At the critical moment, however, a couple of officious policemen
pushed me aside and did it themselves.</p>
<p>There was nothing for me to regret, as the matter turned
out.&nbsp; I should only have rescued a bald-headed commercial
traveller, very drunk, who swore horribly, and pelted the crowd
with empty collar-boxes.</p>
<p>From the window of a very high flat I once watched three men,
resolved to stop a runaway horse.&nbsp; Each man marched
deliberately into the middle of the road and took up his
stand.&nbsp; My window was too far away for me to see their
faces, but their attitude suggested heroism unto death.&nbsp; The
first man, as the horse came charging towards him, faced it with
his arms spread out.&nbsp; He never flinched until the horse was
within about twenty yards of him.&nbsp; Then, as the animal was
evidently determined to continue its wild career, there was
nothing left for him to do but to retire again to the kerb, where
he stood looking after it with evident sorrow, as though saying
to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, well, if you are going to be
headstrong I have done with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second man, on the catastrophe being thus left clear for
him, without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, walked up a bye street
and disappeared.&nbsp; The third man stood his ground, and, as
the horse passed him, yelled at it.&nbsp; I could not hear what
he said.&nbsp; I have not the slightest doubt it was excellent
advice, but the animal was apparently too excited even to
listen.&nbsp; The first and the third man met afterwards, and
discussed the matter sympathetically.&nbsp; I judged they were
regretting the pig-headedness of runaway horses in general, and
hoping that nobody had been hurt.</p>
<p>I forget the other characters I assumed about this
period.&nbsp; One, I know, that got me into a good deal of
trouble was that of a downright, honest, hearty, outspoken young
man who always said what he meant.</p>
<p>I never knew but one man who made a real success of speaking
his mind.&nbsp; I have heard him slap the table with his open
hand and exclaim&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to flatter you&mdash;to stuff you up with a
pack of lies.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not me, that&rsquo;s not Jim
Compton.&nbsp; But if you care for my honest opinion, all I can
say is, that child is the most marvellous performer on the piano
I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say she is a genius,
but I have heard Liszt and Metzler and all the crack players, and
I prefer <i>her</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my opinion.&nbsp; I speak
my mind, and I can&rsquo;t help it if you&rsquo;re
offended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How refreshing,&rdquo; the parents would say, &ldquo;to
come across a man who is not afraid to say what he really
thinks.&nbsp; Why are we not all outspoken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last character I attempted I thought would be easy to
assume.&nbsp; It was that of a much admired and beloved young
man, whose great charm lay in the fact that he was always
just&mdash;himself.&nbsp; Other people posed and acted.&nbsp; He
never made any effort to be anything but his own natural, simple
self.</p>
<p>I thought I also would be my own natural, simple self.&nbsp;
But then the question arose&mdash;What was my own natural, simple
self?</p>
<p>That was the preliminary problem I had to solve;&nbsp; I have
not solved it to this day.&nbsp; What am I?&nbsp; I am a great
gentleman, walking through the world with dauntless heart and
head erect, scornful of all meanness, impatient of all
littleness.&nbsp; I am a mean-thinking, little-daring
man&mdash;the type of man that I of the dauntless heart and the
erect head despise greatly&mdash;crawling to a poor end by
devious ways, cringing to the strong, timid of all pain.&nbsp;
I&mdash;but, dear reader, I will not sadden your sensitive ears
with details I could give you, showing how contemptible a
creature this wretched I happens to be.&nbsp; Nor would you
understand me.&nbsp; You would only be astonished, discovering
that such disreputable specimens of humanity contrive to exist in
this age.&nbsp; It is best, my dear sir, or madam, you should
remain ignorant of these evil persons.&nbsp; Let me not trouble
you with knowledge.</p>
<p>I am a philosopher, greeting alike the thunder and the
sunshine with frolic welcome.&nbsp; Only now and then, when all
things do not fall exactly as I wish them, when foolish, wicked
people will persist in doing foolish, wicked acts, affecting my
comfort and happiness, I rage and fret a goodish deal.</p>
<p>As Heine said of himself, I am knight, too, of the Holy Grail,
valiant for the Truth, reverent of all women, honouring all men,
eager to yield life to the service of my great Captain.</p>
<p>And next moment, I find myself in the enemy&rsquo;s lines,
fighting under the black banner.&nbsp; (It must be confusing to
these opposing Generals, all their soldiers being deserters from
both armies.)&nbsp; What are women but men&rsquo;s
playthings!&nbsp; Shall there be no more cakes and ale for me
because thou art virtuous!&nbsp; What are men but hungry dogs,
contending each against each for a limited supply of bones!&nbsp;
Do others lest thou be done.&nbsp; What is the Truth but an
unexploded lie!</p>
<p>I am a lover of all living things.&nbsp; You, my poor sister,
struggling with your heavy burden on your lonely way, I would
kiss the tears from your worn cheeks, lighten with my love the
darkness around your feet.&nbsp; You, my patient brother,
breathing hard as round and round you tramp the trodden path,
like some poor half-blind gin-horse, stripes your only
encouragement, scanty store of dry chaff in your manger!&nbsp; I
would jog beside you, taking the strain a little from your aching
shoulders; and we would walk nodding, our heads side by side, and
you, remembering, should tell me of the fields where long ago you
played, of the gallant races that you ran and won.&nbsp; And you,
little pinched brats, with wondering eyes, looking from
dirt-encrusted faces, I would take you in my arms and tell you
fairy stories.&nbsp; Into the sweet land of make-believe we would
wander, leaving the sad old world behind us for a time, and you
should be Princes and Princesses, and know Love.</p>
<p>But again, a selfish, greedy man comes often, and sits in my
clothes.&nbsp; A man who frets away his life, planning how to get
more money&mdash;more food, more clothes, more pleasures for
himself; a man so busy thinking of the many things he needs he
has no time to dwell upon the needs of others.&nbsp; He deems
himself the centre of the universe.&nbsp; You would imagine,
hearing him grumbling, that the world had been created and got
ready against the time when he should come to take his pleasure
in it.&nbsp; He would push and trample, heedless, reaching
towards these many desires of his; and when, grabbing, he misses,
he curses Heaven for its injustice, and men and women for getting
in his path.&nbsp; He is not a nice man, in any way.&nbsp; I
wish, as I say, he would not come so often and sit in my
clothes.&nbsp; He persists that he is I, and that I am only a
sentimental fool, spoiling his chances.&nbsp; Sometimes, for a
while, I get rid of him, but he always comes back; and then he
gets rid of me and I become him.&nbsp; It is very
confusing.&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder if I really am myself.</p>
<h2><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>ON THE
DISADVANTAGE OF NOT GETTING WHAT ONE WANTS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Long</span>, long ago, when you and I,
dear Reader, were young, when the fairies dwelt in the hearts of
the roses, when the moonbeams bent each night beneath the weight
of angels&rsquo; feet, there lived a good, wise man.&nbsp; Or
rather, I should say, there had lived, for at the time of which I
speak the poor old gentleman lay dying.&nbsp; Waiting each moment
the dread summons, he fell a-musing on the life that stretched
far back behind him.&nbsp; How full it seemed to him at that
moment of follies and mistakes, bringing bitter tears not to
himself alone but to others also.&nbsp; How much brighter a road
might it have been, had he been wiser, had he known!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, me!&rdquo; said the good old gentleman, &ldquo;if
only I could live my life again in the light of
experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as he spoke these words he felt the drawing near to him of
a Presence, and thinking it was the One whom he expected, raising
himself a little from his bed, he feebly cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a hand forced him gently back, a voice saying, &ldquo;Not
yet; I bring life, not death.&nbsp; Your wish shall be
granted.&nbsp; You shall live your life again, and the knowledge
of the past shall be with you to guide you.&nbsp; See you use
it.&nbsp; I will come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a sleep fell upon the good man, and when he awoke, he was
again a little child, lying in his mother&rsquo;s arms; but,
locked within his brain was the knowledge of the life that he had
lived already.</p>
<p>So once more he lived and loved and laboured.&nbsp; So a
second time he lay an old, worn man with life behind him.&nbsp;
And the angel stood again beside his bed; and the voice said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you content now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am well content,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let Death come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you understood?&rdquo; asked the angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;that
experience is but as of the memory of the pathways he has trod to
a traveller journeying ever onward into an unknown land.&nbsp; I
have been wise only to reap the reward of folly.&nbsp; Knowledge
has ofttimes kept me from my good.&nbsp; I have avoided my old
mistakes only to fall into others that I knew not of.&nbsp; I
have reached the old errors by new roads.&nbsp; Where I have
escaped sorrow I have lost joy.&nbsp; Where I have grasped
happiness I have plucked pain also.&nbsp; Now let me go with
Death that I may learn..&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was so like the angel of that period, the giving of a
gift, bringing to a man only more trouble.&nbsp; Maybe I am
overrating my coolness of judgment under somewhat startling
circumstances, but I am inclined to think that, had I lived in
those days, and had a fairy or an angel come to me, wanting to
give me something&mdash;my soul&rsquo;s desire, or the sum of my
ambition, or any trifle of that kind I should have been short
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pack up that precious bag of tricks of
yours,&rdquo; I should have said to him (it would have been rude,
but that is how I should have felt), &ldquo;and get outside with
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not taking anything in your line
to-day.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t require any supernatural aid to get
me into trouble.&nbsp; All the worry I want I can get down here,
so it&rsquo;s no good your calling.&nbsp; You take that little
joke of yours,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I know
enough not to want to know,&mdash;and run it off on some other
idiot.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not priggish.&nbsp; I have no objection to
an innocent game of &lsquo;catch-questions&rsquo; in the ordinary
way, and when I get a turn myself.&nbsp; But if I&rsquo;ve got to
pay every time, and the stakes are to be my earthly happiness
plus my future existence&mdash;why, I don&rsquo;t play.&nbsp;
There was the case of Midas; a nice, shabby trick you fellows
played off upon him! making pretence you did not understand him,
twisting round the poor old fellow&rsquo;s words, just for all
the world as though you were a pack of Old Bailey lawyers, trying
to trip up a witness; I&rsquo;m ashamed of the lot of you, and I
tell you so&mdash;coming down here, fooling poor unsuspecting
mortals with your nonsense, as though we had not enough to harry
us as it was.&nbsp; Then there was that other case of the poor
old peasant couple to whom you promised three wishes, the whole
thing ending in a black pudding.&nbsp; And they never got even
that.&nbsp; You thought that funny, I suppose.&nbsp; That was
your fairy humour!&nbsp; A pity, I say, you have not, all of you,
something better to do with your time.&nbsp; As I said before,
you take that celestial &lsquo;Joe Miller&rsquo; of yours and
work it off on somebody else.&nbsp; I have read my fairy lore,
and I have read my mythology, and I don&rsquo;t want any of your
blessings.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m not going to
have them.&nbsp; When I want blessings I will put up with the
usual sort we are accustomed to down here.&nbsp; You know the
ones I mean, the disguised brand&mdash;the blessings that no
human being would think were blessings, if he were not told; the
blessings that don&rsquo;t look like blessings, that don&rsquo;t
feel like blessings; that, as a matter of fact, are not
blessings, practically speaking; the blessings that other people
think are blessings for us and that we don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve got their drawbacks, but they are better than
yours, at any rate, and they are sooner over.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
want your blessings at any price.&nbsp; If you leave one here I
shall simply throw it out after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel confident I should have answered in that strain, and I
feel it would have done good.&nbsp; Somebody ought to have spoken
plainly, because with fairies and angels of that sort fooling
about, no one was ever safe for a moment.&nbsp; Children could
hardly have been allowed outside the door.&nbsp; One never could
have told what silly trick some would-be funny fairy might be
waiting to play off on them.&nbsp; The poor child would not know,
and would think it was getting something worth having.&nbsp; The
wonder to me is that some of those angels didn&rsquo;t get tarred
and feathered.</p>
<p>I am doubtful whether even Cinderella&rsquo;s luck was quite
as satisfying as we are led to believe.&nbsp; After the
carpetless kitchen and the black beetles, how beautiful the
palace must have seemed&mdash;for the first year, perhaps for the
first two.&nbsp; And the Prince! how loving, how gallant, how
tender&mdash;for the first year, perhaps for the first two.&nbsp;
And after?&nbsp; You see he was a Prince, brought up in a Court,
the atmosphere of which is not conducive to the development of
the domestic virtues; and she&mdash;was Cinderella.&nbsp; And
then the marriage altogether was rather a hurried affair.&nbsp;
Oh yes, she is a good, loving little woman; but perhaps our Royal
Highness-ship did act too much on the impulse of the
moment.&nbsp; It was her dear, dainty feet that danced their way
into our heart.&nbsp; How they flashed and twinkled, eased in
those fairy slippers.&nbsp; How like a lily among tulips she
moved that night amid the over-gorgeous Court dames.&nbsp; She
was so sweet, so fresh, so different to all the others whom we
knew so well.&nbsp; How happy she looked as she put her trembling
little hand in ours.&nbsp; What possibilities might lie behind
those drooping lashes.&nbsp; And we were in amorous mood that
night, the music in our feet, the flash and glitter in our
eyes.&nbsp; And then, to pique us further, she disappeared as
suddenly and strangely as she had come.&nbsp; Who was she?&nbsp;
Whence came she?&nbsp; What was the mystery surrounding
her?&nbsp; Was she only a delicious dream, a haunting phantasy
that we should never look upon again, never clasp again within
our longing arms?&nbsp; Was our heart to be for ever hungry,
haunted by the memory of&mdash;No, by heavens, she is real, and a
woman.&nbsp; Here is her dear slipper, made surely to be
kissed.&nbsp; Of a size too that a man may well wear within the
breast of his doublet.&nbsp; Had any woman&mdash;nay, fairy,
angel, such dear feet!&nbsp; Search the whole kingdom through,
but find her, find her.&nbsp; The gods have heard our prayers,
and given us this clue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose she be not all she
seemed.&nbsp; Suppose she be not of birth fit to mate with our
noble house!&rdquo;&nbsp; Out upon thee, for an earth-bound,
blind curmudgeon of a Lord High Chancellor.&nbsp; How could a
woman, whom such slipper fitted, be but of the noblest and the
best, as far above us, mere Princelet that we are, as the stars
in heaven are brighter than thy dull old eyes!&nbsp; Go, search
the kingdom, we tell thee, from east to west, from north to
south, and see to it that thou findest her, or it shall go hard
with thee.&nbsp; By Venus, be she a swineherd&rsquo;s daughter,
she shall be our Queen&mdash;an she deign to accept of us, and of
our kingdom.</p>
<p>Ah well, of course, it was not a wise piece of business, that
goes without saying; but we were young, and Princes are only
human.&nbsp; Poor child, she could not help her education, or
rather her lack of it.&nbsp; Dear little thing, the wonder is
that she has contrived to be no more ignorant than she is,
dragged up as she was, neglected and overworked.&nbsp; Nor does
life in a kitchen, amid the companionship of peasants and
menials, tend to foster the intellect.&nbsp; Who can blame her
for being shy and somewhat dull of thought? not we,
generous-minded, kind-hearted Prince that we are.&nbsp; And she
is very affectionate.&nbsp; The family are trying, certainly;
father-in-law not a bad sort, though a little prosy when upon the
subject of his domestic troubles, and a little too fond of his
glass; mamma-in-law, and those two ugly, ill-mannered sisters,
decidedly a nuisance about the palace.&nbsp; Yet what can we do?
they are our relations now, and they do not forget to let us know
it.&nbsp; Well, well, we had to expect that, and things might
have been worse.&nbsp; Anyhow she is not jealous&mdash;thank
goodness.</p>
<p>So the day comes when poor little Cinderella sits alone of a
night in the beautiful palace.&nbsp; The courtiers have gone home
in their carriages.&nbsp; The Lord High Chancellor has bowed
himself out backwards.&nbsp; The Gold-Stick-in-Waiting and the
Grooms of the Chamber have gone to their beds.&nbsp; The Maids of
Honour have said &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; and drifted out of the
door, laughing and whispering among themselves.&nbsp; The clock
strikes twelve&mdash;one&mdash;two, and still no footstep creaks
upon the stair.&nbsp; Once it followed swiftly upon the
&ldquo;good-night&rdquo; of the maids, who did not laugh or
whisper then.</p>
<p>At last the door opens, and the Prince enters, none too
pleased at finding Cinderella still awake.&nbsp; &ldquo;So sorry
I&rsquo;m late, my love&mdash;detained on affairs of state.&nbsp;
Foreign policy very complicated, dear.&nbsp; Have only just this
moment left the Council Chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And little Cinderella, while the Prince sleeps, lies sobbing
out her poor sad heart into the beautiful royal pillow,
embroidered with the royal arms and edged with the royal monogram
in lace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did he ever marry me?&nbsp; I should
have been happier in the old kitchen.&nbsp; The black beetles did
frighten me a little, but there was always the dear old cat; and
sometimes, when mother and the girls were out, papa would call
softly down the kitchen stairs for me to come up, and we would
have such a merry evening together, and sup off sausages: dear
old dad, I hardly ever see him now.&nbsp; And then, when my work
was done, how pleasant it was to sit in front of the fire, and
dream of the wonderful things that would come to me some
day.&nbsp; I was always going to be a Princess, even in my
dreams, and live in a palace, but it was so different to
this.&nbsp; Oh, how I hate it, this beastly palace where
everybody sneers at me&mdash;I know they do, though they bow and
scrape, and pretend to be so polite.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m not
clever and smart as they are.&nbsp; I hate them.&nbsp; I hate
these bold-faced women who are always here.&nbsp; That is the
worst of a palace, everybody can come in.&nbsp; Oh, I hate
everybody and everything.&nbsp; Oh, god-mamma, god-mamma, come
and take me away.&nbsp; Take me back to my old kitchen.&nbsp;
Give me back my old poor frock.&nbsp; Let me dance again with the
fire-tongs for a partner, and be happy, dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor little Cinderella, perhaps it would have been better had
god-mamma been less ambitious for you, dear; had you married some
good, honest yeoman, who would never have known that you were not
brilliant, who would have loved you because you were just amiable
and pretty; had your kingdom been only a farmhouse, where your
knowledge of domestic economy, gained so hardly, would have been
useful; where you would have shone instead of being overshadowed;
where Papa would have dropped in of an evening to smoke his pipe
and escape from his domestic wrangles; where you would have been
<i>real</i> Queen.</p>
<p>But then you know, dear, you would not have been
content.&nbsp; Ah yes, with your present experience&mdash;now you
know that Queens as well as little drudges have their troubles;
but <i>without</i> that experience?&nbsp; You would have looked
in the glass when you were alone; you would have looked at your
shapely hands and feet, and the shadows would have crossed your
pretty face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you would have said to
yourself&mdash;&ldquo;John is a dear, kind fellow, and I love him
very much, and all that, but&mdash;&rdquo; and the old dreams,
dreamt in the old low-ceilinged kitchen before the dying fire,
would have come back to you, and you would have been discontented
then as now, only in a different way.&nbsp; Oh yes, you would,
Cinderella, though you gravely shake your gold-crowned
head.&nbsp; And let me tell you why.&nbsp; It is because you are
a woman, and the fate of all us, men and women alike, is to be
for ever wanting what we have not, and to be finding, when we
have it, that it is not what we wanted.&nbsp; That is the law of
life, dear.&nbsp; Do you think as you lie upon the floor with
your head upon your arms, that you are the only woman whose tears
are soaking into the hearthrug at that moment?&nbsp; My dear
Princess, if you could creep unseen about your City, peeping at
will through the curtain-shielded windows, you would come to
think that all the world was little else than a big nursery full
of crying children with none to comfort them.&nbsp; The doll is
broken: no longer it sweetly squeaks in answer to our pressure,
&ldquo;I love you, kiss me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The drum lies silent
with the drumstick inside; no longer do we make a brave noise in
the nursery.&nbsp; The box of tea-things we have clumsily put our
foot upon; there will be no more merry parties around the
three-legged stool.&nbsp; The tin trumpet will not play the note
we want to sound; the wooden bricks keep falling down; the toy
cannon has exploded and burnt our fingers.&nbsp; Never mind,
little man, little woman, we will try and mend things
to-morrow.</p>
<p>And after all, Cinderella dear, you do live in a fine palace,
and you have jewels and grand dresses and&mdash;No, no, do not be
indignant with <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Did not you dream of these things
<i>as well as</i> of love?&nbsp; Come now, be honest.&nbsp; It
was always a prince, was it not, or, at the least, an exceedingly
well-to-do party, that handsome young gentleman who bowed to you
so gallantly from the red embers?&nbsp; He was never a virtuous
young commercial traveller, or cultured clerk, earning a salary
of three pounds a week, was he, Cinderella?&nbsp; Yet there are
many charming commercial travellers, many delightful clerks with
limited incomes, quite sufficient, however, to a sensible man and
woman desiring but each other&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Why was it
always a prince, Cinderella?&nbsp; Had the palace and the
liveried servants, and the carriages and horses, and the jewels
and the dresses, <i>nothing</i> to do with the dream?</p>
<p>No, Cinderella, you were human, that is all.&nbsp; The artist,
shivering in his conventional attic, dreaming of Fame!&mdash;do
you think he is not hoping she will come to his loving arms in
the form Jove came to Danae?&nbsp; Do you think he is not
reckoning also upon the good dinners and the big cigars, the fur
coat and the diamond studs, that her visits will enable him to
purchase?</p>
<p>There is a certain picture very popular just now.&nbsp; You
may see it, Cinderella, in many of the shop-windows of the
town.&nbsp; It is called &ldquo;The Dream of Love,&rdquo; and it
represents a beautiful young girl, sleeping in a very beautiful
but somewhat disarranged bed.&nbsp; Indeed, one hopes, for the
sleeper&rsquo;s sake, that the night is warm, and that the room
is fairly free from draughts.&nbsp; A ladder of light streams
down from the sky into the room, and upon this ladder crowd and
jostle one another a small army of plump Cupids, each one laden
with some pledge of love.&nbsp; Two of the Imps are emptying a
sack of jewels upon the floor.&nbsp; Four others are bearing,
well displayed, a magnificent dress (a &ldquo;confection,&rdquo;
I believe, is the proper term) cut somewhat low, but making up in
train what is lacking elsewhere.&nbsp; Others bear bonnet boxes
from which peep stylish toques and bewitching hoods.&nbsp; Some,
representing evidently wholesale houses, stagger under silks and
satins in the piece.&nbsp; Cupids are there from the shoemakers
with the daintiest of <i>bottines</i>.&nbsp; Stockings, garters,
and even less mentionable articles, are not forgotten.&nbsp;
Caskets, mirrors, twelve-buttoned gloves, scent-bottles and
handkerchiefs, hair-pins, and the gayest of parasols, has the God
of Love piled into the arms of his messengers.&nbsp; Really a
most practical, up-to-date God of Love, moving with the
times!&nbsp; One feels that the modern Temple of Love must be a
sort of Swan and Edgar&rsquo;s; the god himself a kind of
celestial shop-walker; while his mother, Venus, no doubt
superintends the costume department.&nbsp; Quite an Olympian
Whiteley, this latter-day Eros; he has forgotten nothing, for, at
the back of the picture, I notice one Cupid carrying a rather fat
heart at the end of a string.</p>
<p>You, Cinderella, could give good counsel to that sleeping
child.&nbsp; You would say to her&mdash;&ldquo;Awake from such
dreams.&nbsp; The contents of a pawnbroker&rsquo;s store-room
will not bring you happiness.&nbsp; Dream of love if you will;
that is a wise dream, even if it remain ever a dream.&nbsp; But
these coloured beads, these Manchester goods! are you
then&mdash;you, heiress of all the ages&mdash;still at heart only
as some poor savage maiden but little removed above the monkeys
that share the primeval forest with her?&nbsp; Will you sell your
gold to the first trader that brings you <i>this</i>
barter?&nbsp; These things, child, will only dazzle your eyes for
a few days.&nbsp; Do you think the Burlington Arcade is the gate
of Heaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, I too could talk like that&mdash;I, writer of books,
to the young lad, sick of his office stool, dreaming of a
literary career leading to fame and fortune.&nbsp; &ldquo;And do
you think, lad, that by that road you will reach Happiness sooner
than by another?&nbsp; Do you think interviews with yourself in
penny weeklies will bring you any satisfaction after the first
halfdozen?&nbsp; Do you think the gushing female who has read all
your books, and who wonders what it must feel like to be so
clever, will be welcome to you the tenth time you meet her?&nbsp;
Do you think press cuttings will always consist of wondering
admiration of your genius, of paragraphs about your charming
personal appearance under the heading, &lsquo;Our
Celebrities&rsquo;?&nbsp; Have you thought of the Uncomplimentary
criticisms, of the spiteful paragraphs, of the everlasting fear
of slipping a few inches down the greasy pole called
&lsquo;popular taste,&rsquo; to which you are condemned to cling
for life, as some lesser criminal to his weary tread-mill,
struggling with no hope but not to fall!&nbsp; Make a home, lad,
for the woman who loves you; gather one or two friends about you;
work, think, and play, that will bring you happiness.&nbsp; Shun
this roaring gingerbread fair that calls itself, forsooth, the
&lsquo;World of art and letters.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let its clowns and
its contortionists fight among themselves for the plaudits and
the halfpence of the mob.&nbsp; Let it be with its shouting and
its surging, its blare and its cheap flare.&nbsp; Come away, the
summer&rsquo;s night is just the other side of the hedge, with
its silence and its stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You and I, Cinderella, are experienced people, and can
therefore offer good advice, but do you think we should be
listened to?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, my Prince is not as yours.&nbsp; Mine will love
me always, and I am peculiarly fitted for the life of a
palace.&nbsp; I have the instinct and the ability for it.&nbsp; I
am sure I was made for a princess.&nbsp; Thank you, Cinderella,
for your well-meant counsel, but there is much difference between
you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is the answer you would receive, Cinderella; and my young
friend would say to me, &ldquo;Yes, I can understand <i>your</i>
finding disappointment in the literary career; but then, you see,
our cases are not quite similar.&nbsp; <i>I</i> am not likely to
find much trouble in keeping my position.&nbsp; <i>I</i> shall
not fear reading what the critics say of <i>me</i>.&nbsp; No
doubt there are disadvantages, when you are among the ruck, but
there is always plenty of room at the top.&nbsp; So thank you,
and goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides, Cinderella dear, we should not quite mean
it&mdash;this excellent advice.&nbsp; We have grown accustomed to
these gew-gaws, and we should miss them in spite of our knowledge
of their trashiness: you, your palace and your little gold crown;
I, my mountebank&rsquo;s cap, and the answering laugh that goes
up from the crowd when I shake my bells.&nbsp; We want
everything.&nbsp; All the happiness that earth and heaven are
capable of bestowing.&nbsp; Creature comforts, and heart and soul
comforts also; and, proud-spirited beings that we are, we will
not be put off with a part.&nbsp; Give us only everything, and we
will be content.&nbsp; And, after all, Cinderella, you have had
your day.&nbsp; Some little dogs never get theirs.&nbsp; You must
not be greedy.&nbsp; You have <i>known</i> happiness.&nbsp; The
palace was Paradise for those few months, and the Prince&rsquo;s
arms were about you, Cinderella, the Prince&rsquo;s kisses on
your lips; the gods themselves cannot take <i>that</i> from
you.</p>
<p>The cake cannot last for ever if we will eat of it so
greedily.&nbsp; There must come the day when we have picked
hungrily the last crumb&mdash;when we sit staring at the empty
board, nothing left of the feast, Cinderella, but the pain that
comes of feasting.</p>
<p>It is a na&iuml;ve confession, poor Human Nature has made to
itself, in choosing, as it has, this story of Cinderella for its
leading moral:&mdash;Be good, little girl.&nbsp; Be meek under
your many trials.&nbsp; Be gentle and kind, in spite of your hard
lot, and one day&mdash;you shall marry a prince and ride in your
own carriage.&nbsp; Be brave and true, little boy.&nbsp; Work
hard and wait with patience, and in the end, with God&rsquo;s
blessing, you shall earn riches enough to come back to London
town and marry your master&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>You and I, gentle Reader, could teach these young folks a
truer lesson, an we would.&nbsp; We know, alas! that the road of
all the virtues does not lead to wealth, rather the contrary;
else how explain our limited incomes?&nbsp; But would it be well,
think you, to tell them bluntly the truth&mdash;that honesty is
the most expensive luxury a man can indulge in; that virtue, if
persisted in, leads, generally speaking, to a six-roomed house in
an outlying suburb?&nbsp; Maybe the world is wise: the fiction
has its uses.</p>
<p>I am acquainted with a fairly intelligent young lady.&nbsp;
She can read and write, knows her tables up to six times, and can
argue.&nbsp; I regard her as representative of average Humanity
in its attitude towards Fate; and this is a dialogue I lately
overheard between her and an older lady who is good enough to
occasionally impart to her the wisdom of the world&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been good this morning, haven&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh yes, fairly good, for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think Papa <i>will</i> take me to the circus
to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you keep good.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t get
naughty this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was good on Monday, you may remember,
nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tolerably good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Very</i> good, you said, nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, you weren&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was to have gone to the pantomime, and I
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was because your aunt came up suddenly, and
your Papa couldn&rsquo;t get another seat.&nbsp; Poor auntie
wouldn&rsquo;t have gone at all if she hadn&rsquo;t gone
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll come up suddenly
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I hope she doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I want to go to the
circus to-night.&nbsp; Because, you see, nurse, if I don&rsquo;t
it will discourage me.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>So, perhaps the world is wise in promising us the
circus.&nbsp; We believe her at first.&nbsp; But after a while, I
fear, we grow discouraged.</p>
<h2><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>ON THE
EXCEPTIONAL MERIT ATTACHING TO THE THINGS WE MEANT TO DO</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">can</span> remember&mdash;but then I can
remember a long time ago.&nbsp; You, gentle Reader, just entering
upon the prime of life, that age by thoughtless youth called
middle, I cannot, of course, expect to follow me&mdash;when there
was in great demand a certain periodical ycleped <i>The
Amateur</i>.&nbsp; Its aim was noble.&nbsp; It sought to teach
the beautiful lesson of independence, to inculcate the fine
doctrine of self-help.&nbsp; One chapter explained to a man how
he might make flower-pots out of Australian meat cans; another
how he might turn butter-tubs into music-stools; a third how he
might utilize old bonnet boxes for Venetian blinds: that was the
principle of the whole scheme, you made everything from something
not intended for it, and as ill-suited to the purpose as
possible.</p>
<p>Two pages, I distinctly recollect, were devoted to the
encouragement of the manufacture of umbrella stands out of old
gaspiping.&nbsp; Anything less adapted to the receipt of hats and
umbrellas than gas-piping I cannot myself conceive: had there
been, I feel sure the author would have thought of it, and would
have recommended it.</p>
<p>Picture-frames you fashioned out of ginger-beer corks.&nbsp;
You saved your ginger-beer corks, you found a picture&mdash;and
the thing was complete.&nbsp; How much ginger-beer it would be
necessary to drink, preparatory to the making of each frame; and
the effect of it upon the frame-maker&rsquo;s physical, mental
and moral well-being, did not concern <i>The Amateur</i>.&nbsp; I
calculate that for a fair-sized picture sixteen dozen bottles
might suffice.&nbsp; Whether, after sixteen dozen of ginger-beer,
a man would take any interest in framing a picture&mdash;whether
he would retain any pride in the picture itself, is
doubtful.&nbsp; But this, of course, was not the point.</p>
<p>One young gentleman of my acquaintance&mdash;the son of the
gardener of my sister, as friend Ollendorff would have described
him&mdash;did succeed in getting through sufficient ginger-beer
to frame his grandfather, but the result was not
encouraging.&nbsp; Indeed, the gardener&rsquo;s wife herself was
but ill satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all them corks round father?&rdquo; was
her first question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; was the somewhat indignant
reply, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but why corks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the book said corks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the old lady remained unimpressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow it don&rsquo;t look like father now,&rdquo; she
sighed.</p>
<p>Her eldest born grew irritable: none of us appreciate
criticism!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it look like, then?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno.&nbsp; Seems to me to look like nothing
but corks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady&rsquo;s view was correct.&nbsp; Certain schools
of art possibly lend themselves to this method of framing.&nbsp;
I myself have seen a funeral card improved by it; but, generally
speaking, the consequence was a predominance of frame at the
expense of the thing framed.&nbsp; The more honest and tasteful
of the framemakers would admit as much themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is ugly when you look at it,&rdquo; said one to
me, as we stood surveying it from the centre of the room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But what one feels about it is that one has done it
oneself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which reflection, I have noticed, reconciles us to many other
things beside cork frames.</p>
<p>Another young gentleman friend of mine&mdash;for I am bound to
admit it was youth that profited most by the advice and counsel
of <i>The Amateur</i>: I suppose as one grows older one grows
less daring, less industrious&mdash;made a rocking-chair,
according to the instructions of this book, out of a couple of
beer barrels.&nbsp; From every practical point of view it was a
bad rocking-chair.&nbsp; It rocked too much, and it rocked in too
many directions at one and the same time.&nbsp; I take it, a man
sitting on a rocking-chair does not want to be continually
rocking.&nbsp; There comes a time when he says to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;Now I have rocked sufficiently for the
present; now I will sit still for a while, lest a worse thing
befall me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this was one of those headstrong
rocking-chairs that are a danger to humanity, and a nuisance to
themselves.&nbsp; Its notion was that it was made to rock, and
that when it was not rocking, it was wasting its time.&nbsp; Once
started nothing could stop it&mdash;nothing ever did stop it,
until it found itself topsy turvy on its own occupant.&nbsp; That
was the only thing that ever sobered it.</p>
<p>I had called, and had been shown into the empty
drawing-room.&nbsp; The rocking-chair nodded invitingly at
me.&nbsp; I never guessed it was an amateur rocking-chair.&nbsp;
I was young in those days, with faith in human nature, and I
imagined that, whatever else a man might attempt without
knowledge or experience, no one would be fool enough to
experiment upon a rocking-chair.</p>
<p>I threw myself into it lightly and carelessly.&nbsp; I
immediately noticed the ceiling.&nbsp; I made an instinctive
movement forward.&nbsp; The window and a momentary glimpse of the
wooded hills beyond shot upwards and disappeared.&nbsp; The
carpet flashed across my eyes, and I caught sight of my own boots
vanishing beneath me at the rate of about two hundred miles an
hour.&nbsp; I made a convulsive effort to recover them.&nbsp; I
suppose I over-did it.&nbsp; I saw the whole of the room at once,
the four walls, the ceiling, and the floor at the same
moment.&nbsp; It was a sort of vision.&nbsp; I saw the cottage
piano upside down, and I again saw my own boots flash past me,
this time over my head, soles uppermost.&nbsp; Never before had I
been in a position where my own boots had seemed so
all-pervading.&nbsp; The next moment I lost my boots, and stopped
the carpet with my head just as it was rushing past me.&nbsp; At
the same instant something hit me violently in the small of the
back.&nbsp; Reason, when recovered, suggested that my assailant
must be the rocking-chair.</p>
<p>Investigation proved the surmise correct.&nbsp; Fortunately I
was still alone, and in consequence was able, a few minutes
later, to meet my hostess with calm and dignity.&nbsp; I said
nothing about the rocking-chair.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I was
hoping to have the pleasure, before I went, of seeing some other
guest arrive and sample it: I had purposely replaced it in the
most prominent and convenient position.&nbsp; But though I felt
capable of schooling myself to silence, I found myself unable to
agree with my hostess when she called for my admiration of the
thing.&nbsp; My recent experiences had too deeply embittered
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie made it himself,&rdquo; explained the fond
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it was very clever of
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it was clever,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I am
willing to admit that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made it out of some old beer barrels,&rdquo; she
continued; she seemed proud of it.</p>
<p>My resentment, though I tried to keep it under control, was
mounting higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! did he?&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I should have thought
he might have found something better to do with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, many things,&rdquo; I retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He might have filled them again with beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hostess looked at me astonished.&nbsp; I felt some reason
for my tone was expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;it is not a
well-made chair.&nbsp; These rockers are too short, and they are
too curved, and one of them, if you notice, is higher than the
other and of a smaller radius; the back is at too obtuse an
angle.&nbsp; When it is occupied the centre of gravity
becomes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hostess interrupted me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been sitting on it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for long,&rdquo; I assured her.</p>
<p>Her tone changed.&nbsp; She became apologetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It looks
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;that is where the dear
lad&rsquo;s cleverness displays itself.&nbsp; Its appearance
disarms suspicion.&nbsp; With judgment that chair might be made
to serve a really useful purpose.&nbsp; There are mutual
acquaintances of ours&mdash;I mention no names, you will know
them&mdash;pompous, self-satisfied, superior persons who would be
improved by that chair.&nbsp; If I were Willie I should disguise
the mechanism with some artistic drapery, bait the thing with a
couple of exceptionally inviting cushions, and employ it to
inculcate modesty and diffidence.&nbsp; I defy any human being to
get out of that chair, feeling as important as when he got into
it.&nbsp; What the dear boy has done has been to construct an
automatic exponent of the transitory nature of human
greatness.&nbsp; As a moral agency that chair should prove a
blessing in disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hostess smiled feebly; more, I fear, from politeness than
genuine enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are too severe,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When you remember that the boy has never tried his hand at
anything of the kind before, that he has no knowledge and no
experience, it really is not so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering the matter from that point of view I was bound to
concur.&nbsp; I did not like to suggest to her that before
entering upon a difficult task it would be better for young men
to <i>acquire</i> knowledge and experience: that is so unpopular
a theory.</p>
<p>But the thing that <i>The Amateur</i> put in the front and
foremost of its propaganda was the manufacture of household
furniture out of egg-boxes.&nbsp; Why egg-boxes I have never been
able to understand, but egg-boxes, according to the prescription
of <i>The Amateur</i>, formed the foundation of household
existence.&nbsp; With a sufficient supply of egg-boxes, and what
<i>The Amateur</i> termed a &ldquo;natural deftness,&rdquo; no
young couple need hesitate to face the furnishing problem.&nbsp;
Three egg-boxes made a writing-table; on another egg-box you sat
to write; your books were ranged in egg-boxes around
you&mdash;and there was your study, complete.</p>
<p>For the dining-room two egg-boxes made an overmantel; four
egg-boxes and a piece of looking-glass a sideboard; while six
egg-boxes, with some wadding and a yard or so of cretonne,
constituted a so-called &ldquo;cosy corner.&rdquo;&nbsp; About
the &ldquo;corner&rdquo; there could be no possible doubt.&nbsp;
You sat on a corner, you leant against a corner; whichever way
you moved you struck a fresh corner.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;cosiness,&rdquo; however, I deny.&nbsp; Egg-boxes I admit
can be made useful; I am even prepared to imagine them
ornamental; but &ldquo;cosy,&rdquo; no.&nbsp; I have sampled
egg-boxes in many shapes.&nbsp; I speak of years ago, when the
world and we were younger, when our fortune was the Future;
secure in which, we hesitated not to set up house upon incomes
folks with lesser expectations might have deemed
insufficient.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, the sole
alternative to the egg-box, or similar school of furniture, would
have been the strictly classical, consisting of a doorway joined
to architectural proportions.</p>
<p>I have from Saturday to Monday, as honoured guest, hung my
clothes in egg-boxes.</p>
<p>I have sat on an egg-box at an egg-box to take my dish of
tea.&nbsp; I have made love on egg-boxes.&mdash;Aye, and to feel
again the blood running through my veins as then it ran, I would
be content to sit only on egg-boxes till the time should come
when I could be buried in an egg-box, with an egg-box reared
above me as tombstone.&mdash;I have spent many an evening on an
egg-box; I have gone to bed in egg-boxes.&nbsp; They have their
points&mdash;I am intending no pun&mdash;but to claim for them
cosiness would be but to deceive.</p>
<p>How quaint they were, those home-made rooms!&nbsp; They rise
out of the shadows and shape themselves again before my
eyes.&nbsp; I see the knobbly sofa; the easy-chairs that might
have been designed by the Grand Inquisitor himself; the dented
settle that was a bed by night; the few blue plates, purchased in
the slums off Wardour Street; the enamelled stool to which one
always stuck; the mirror framed in silk; the two Japanese fans
crossed beneath each cheap engraving; the piano cloth embroidered
in peacock&rsquo;s feathers by Annie&rsquo;s sister; the
tea-cloth worked by Cousin Jenny.&nbsp; We dreamt, sitting on
those egg-boxes&mdash;for we were young ladies and gentlemen with
artistic taste&mdash;of the days when we would eat in Chippendale
dining-rooms; sip our coffee in Louis Quatorze drawing-rooms; and
be happy.&nbsp; Well, we have got on, some of us, since then, as
Mr. Bumpus used to say; and I notice, when on visits, that some
of us have contrived so that we do sit on Chippendale chairs, at
Sheraton dining-tables, and are warmed from Adam&rsquo;s
fireplaces; but, ah me, where are the dreams, the hopes, the
enthusiasms that clung like the scent of a March morning about
those gim-crack second floors?&nbsp; In the dustbin, I fear, with
the cretonne-covered egg-boxes and the penny fans.&nbsp; Fate is
so terribly even-handed.&nbsp; As she gives she ever takes
away.&nbsp; She flung us a few shillings and hope, where now she
doles us out pounds and fears.&nbsp; Why did not we know how
happy we were, sitting crowned with sweet conceit upon our
egg-box thrones?</p>
<p>Yes, Dick, you have climbed well.&nbsp; You edit a great
newspaper.&nbsp; You spread abroad the message&mdash;well, the
message that Sir Joseph Goldbug, your proprietor, instructs you
to spread abroad.&nbsp; You teach mankind the lessons that Sir
Joseph Goldbug wishes them to learn.&nbsp; They say he is to have
a peerage next year.&nbsp; I am sure he has earned it; and
perhaps there may be a knighthood for you, Dick.</p>
<p>Tom, you are getting on now.&nbsp; You have abandoned those
unsaleable allegories.&nbsp; What rich art patron cares to be
told continually by his own walls that Midas had ass&rsquo;s
ears; that Lazarus sits ever at the gate?&nbsp; You paint
portraits now, and everybody tells me you are the coming
man.&nbsp; That &ldquo;Impression&rdquo; of old Lady Jezebel was
really wonderful.&nbsp; The woman looks quite handsome, and yet
it is her ladyship.&nbsp; Your touch is truly marvellous.</p>
<p>But into your success, Tom&mdash;Dick, old friend, do not
there creep moments when you would that we could fish up those
old egg-boxes from the past, refurnish with them the dingy rooms
in Camden Town, and find there our youth, our loves, and our
beliefs?</p>
<p>An incident brought back to my mind, the other day, the
thought of all these things.&nbsp; I called for the first time
upon a man, an actor, who had asked me to come and see him in the
little home where he lives with his old father.&nbsp; To my
astonishment&mdash;for the craze, I believe, has long since died
out&mdash;I found the house half furnished out of packing cases,
butter tubs, and egg-boxes.&nbsp; My friend earns his twenty
pounds a week, but it was the old father&rsquo;s hobby, so he
explained to me, the making of these monstrosities; and of them
he was as proud as though they were specimen furniture out of the
South Kensington Museum.</p>
<p>He took me into the dining-room to show me the latest
outrage&mdash;a new book-case.&nbsp; A greater disfigurement to
the room, which was otherwise prettily furnished, could hardly be
imagined.&nbsp; There was no need for him to assure me, as he
did, that it had been made out of nothing but egg-boxes.&nbsp;
One could see at a glance that it was made out of egg-boxes, and
badly constructed egg-boxes at that&mdash;egg-boxes that were a
disgrace to the firm that had turned them out; egg-boxes not
worthy the storage of &ldquo;shop &rsquo;uns&rdquo; at eighteen
the shilling.</p>
<p>We went upstairs to my friend&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp; He opened
the door as a man might open the door of a museum of gems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old boy,&rdquo; he said, as he stood with his hand
upon the door-knob, &ldquo;made everything you see here,
everything,&rdquo; and we entered.&nbsp; He drew my attention to
the wardrobe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I will hold it up,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;while you pull the door open; I think the floor must be a
bit uneven, it wobbles if you are not careful.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
wobbled notwithstanding, but by coaxing and humouring we
succeeded without mishap.&nbsp; I was surprised to notice a very
small supply of clothes within, although my friend is a dressy
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I dare not use it
more than I can help.&nbsp; I am a clumsy chap, and as likely as
not, if I happened to be in a hurry, I&rsquo;d have the whole
thing over:&rdquo; which seemed probable.</p>
<p>I asked him how he contrived.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dress in the
bath-room as a rule,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I keep most of my
things there.&nbsp; Of course the old boy doesn&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed me a chest of drawers.&nbsp; One drawer stood half
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to leave that drawer open,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;I keep the things I use in that.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t shut quite easily, these drawers; or rather, they
shut all right, but then they won&rsquo;t open.&nbsp; It is the
weather, I think.&nbsp; They will open and shut all right in the
summer, I dare say.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is of a hopeful
disposition.</p>
<p>But the pride of the room was the washstand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo; cried he
enthusiastically, &ldquo;real marble top&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not expatiate further.&nbsp; In his excitement he had
laid his hand upon the thing, with the natural result that it
collapsed.&nbsp; More by accident than design I caught the jug in
my arms.&nbsp; I also caught the water it contained.&nbsp; The
basin rolled on its edge and little damage was done, except to me
and the soap-box.</p>
<p>I could not pump up much admiration for this washstand; I was
feeling too wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do when you want to wash?&rdquo; I asked,
as together we reset the trap.</p>
<p>There fell upon him the manner of a conspirator revealing
secrets.&nbsp; He glanced guiltily round the room; then, creeping
on tip-toe, he opened a cupboard behind the bed.&nbsp; Within was
a tin basin and a small can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell the old boy,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I keep these things here, and wash on the
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the best thing I myself ever got out of
egg-boxes&mdash;that picture of a deceitful son stealthily
washing himself upon the floor behind the bed, trembling at every
footstep lest it might be the &ldquo;old boy&rdquo; coming to the
door.</p>
<p>One wonders whether the Ten Commandments are so all-sufficient
as we good folk deem them&mdash;whether the eleventh is not worth
the whole pack of them: &ldquo;that ye love one another&rdquo;
with just a common-place, human, practical love.&nbsp; Could not
the other ten be comfortably stowed away into a corner of
that!&nbsp; One is inclined, in one&rsquo;s anarchic moments, to
agree with Louis Stevenson, that to be amiable and cheerful is a
good religion for a work-a-day world.&nbsp; We are so busy
<i>not</i> killing, <i>not</i> stealing, <i>not</i> coveting our
neighbour&rsquo;s wife, we have not time to be even just to one
another for the little while we are together here.&nbsp; Need we
be so cocksure that our present list of virtues and vices is the
only possibly correct and complete one?&nbsp; Is the kind,
unselfish man necessarily a villain because he does not always
succeed in suppressing his natural instincts?&nbsp; Is the
narrow-hearted, sour-souled man, incapable of a generous thought
or act, necessarily a saint because he has none?&nbsp; Have we
not&mdash;we unco guid&mdash;arrived at a wrong method of
estimating our frailer brothers and sisters?&nbsp; We judge them,
as critics judge books, not by the good that is in them, but by
their faults.&nbsp; Poor King David!&nbsp; What would the local
Vigilance Society have had to say to him?&nbsp; Noah, according
to our plan, would be denounced from every teetotal platform in
the country, and Ham would head the Local Vestry poll as a reward
for having exposed him.&nbsp; And St. Peter! weak, frail St.
Peter, how lucky for him that his fellow-disciples and their
Master were not as strict in their notions of virtue as are we
to-day.</p>
<p>Have we not forgotten the meaning of the word
&ldquo;virtue&rdquo;?&nbsp; Once it stood for the good that was
in a man, irrespective of the evil that might lie there also, as
tares among the wheat.&nbsp; We have abolished virtue, and for it
substituted virtues.&nbsp; Not the hero&mdash;he was too full of
faults&mdash;but the blameless valet; not the man who does any
good, but the man who has not been found out in any evil, is our
modern ideal.&nbsp; The most virtuous thing in nature, according
to this new theory, should be the oyster.&nbsp; He is always at
home, and always sober.&nbsp; He is not noisy.&nbsp; He gives no
trouble to the police.&nbsp; I cannot think of a single one of
the Ten Commandments that he ever breaks.&nbsp; He never enjoys
himself, and he never, so long as he lives, gives a
moment&rsquo;s pleasure to any other living thing.</p>
<p>I can imagine the oyster lecturing a lion on the subject of
morality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never hear me,&rdquo; the oyster might say,
&ldquo;howling round camps and villages, making night hideous,
frightening quiet folk out of their lives.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t
you go to bed early, as I do?&nbsp; I never prowl round the
oyster-bed, fighting other gentlemen oysters, making love to lady
oysters already married.&nbsp; I never kill antelopes or
missionaries.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t you live as I do on salt
water and germs, or whatever it is that I do live on?&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you try to be more like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An oyster has no evil passions, therefore we say he is a
virtuous fish.&nbsp; We never ask ourselves&mdash;&ldquo;Has he
any good passions?&rdquo;&nbsp; A lion&rsquo;s behaviour is often
such as no just man could condone.&nbsp; Has he not his good
points also?</p>
<p>Will the fat, sleek, &ldquo;virtuous&rdquo; man be as Welcome
at the gate of heaven as he supposes?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; St. Peter may say to him, opening the door
a little way and looking him up and down, &ldquo;what is it
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; the virtuous man will reply, with
an oily, self-satisfied smile; &ldquo;I should say,
I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see you have come; but what is your claim to
admittance?&nbsp; What have you done with your three score years
and ten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; the virtuous man will answer, &ldquo;I
have done nothing, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing; that is my strong point; that is why I am
here.&nbsp; I have never done any wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what good have you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, what good?&nbsp; Do not you even know the meaning
of the word?&nbsp; What human creature is the better for your
having eaten and drunk and slept these years?&nbsp; You have done
no harm&mdash;no harm to yourself.&nbsp; Perhaps, if you had you
might have done some good with it; the two are generally to be
found together down below, I remember.&nbsp; What good have you
done that you should enter here?&nbsp; This is no mummy chamber;
this is the place of men and women who have lived, who have
wrought good&mdash;and evil also, alas!&mdash;for the sinners who
fight for the right, not the righteous who run with their souls
from the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not, however, to speak of these things that I
remembered <i>The Amateur</i> and its lessons.&nbsp; My intention
was but to lead up to the story of a certain small boy, who in
the doing of tasks not required of him was exceedingly
clever.&nbsp; I wish to tell you his story, because, as do most
true tales, it possesses a moral, and stories without a moral I
deem to be but foolish literature, resembling roads that lead to
nowhere, such as sick folk tramp for exercise.</p>
<p>I have known this little boy to take an expensive eight-day
clock to pieces, and make of it a toy steamboat.&nbsp; True, it
was not, when made, very much of a steamboat; but taking into
consideration all the difficulties&mdash;the inadaptability of
eight-day clock machinery to steamboat requirements, the
necessity of getting the work accomplished quickly, before
conservatively-minded people with no enthusiasm for science could
interfere&mdash;a good enough steamboat.&nbsp; With merely an
ironing-board and a few dozen meat-skewers, he
would&mdash;provided the ironing-board was not missed in
time&mdash;turn out quite a practicable rabbit-hutch.&nbsp; He
could make a gun out of an umbrella and a gas-bracket, which, if
not so accurate as a Martini-Henry, was, at all events, more
deadly.&nbsp; With half the garden-hose, a copper scalding-pan
out of the dairy, and a few Dresden china ornaments off the
drawing-room mantelpiece, he would build a fountain for the
garden.&nbsp; He could make bookshelves out of kitchen tables,
and crossbows out of crinolines.&nbsp; He could dam you a stream
so that all the water would flow over the croquet lawn.&nbsp; He
knew how to make red paint and oxygen gas, together with many
other suchlike commodities handy to have about a house.&nbsp;
Among other things he learned how to make fireworks, and after a
few explosions of an unimportant character, came to make them
very well indeed.&nbsp; The boy who can play a good game of
cricket is liked.&nbsp; The boy who can fight well is
respected.&nbsp; The boy who can cheek a master is loved.&nbsp;
But the boy who can make fireworks is revered above all others as
a boy belonging to a superior order of beings.&nbsp; The fifth of
November was at hand, and with the consent of an indulgent
mother, he determined to give to the world a proof of his
powers.&nbsp; A large party of friends, relatives, and
school-mates was invited, and for a fortnight beforehand the
scullery was converted into a manufactory for fireworks.&nbsp;
The female servants went about in hourly terror of their lives,
and the villa, did we judge exclusively by smell, one might have
imagined had been taken over by Satan, his main premises being
inconveniently crowded, as an annex.&nbsp; By the evening of the
fourth all was in readiness, and samples were tested to make sure
that no contretemps should occur the following night.&nbsp; All
was found to be perfect.</p>
<p>The rockets rushed heavenward and descended in stars, the
Roman candles tossed their fiery balls into the darkness, the
Catherine wheels sparkled and whirled, the crackers cracked, and
the squibs banged.&nbsp; That night he went to bed a proud and
happy boy, and dreamed of fame.&nbsp; He stood surrounded by
blazing fireworks, and the vast crowd cheered him.&nbsp; His
relations, most of whom, he knew, regarded him as the coming
idiot of the family, were there to witness his triumph; so too
was Dickey Bowles, who laughed at him because he could not throw
straight.&nbsp; The girl at the bun-shop, she also was there, and
saw that he was clever.</p>
<p>The night of the festival arrived, and with it the
guests.&nbsp; They sat, wrapped up in shawls and cloaks, outside
the hall door&mdash;uncles, cousins, aunts, little boys and big
boys, little girls and big girls, with, as the theatre posters
say, villagers and retainers, some forty of them in all, and
waited.</p>
<p>But the fireworks did not go off.&nbsp; Why they did not go
off I cannot explain; nobody ever <i>could</i> explain.&nbsp; The
laws of nature seemed to be suspended for that night only.&nbsp;
The rockets fell down and died where they stood.&nbsp; No human
agency seemed able to ignite the squibs.&nbsp; The crackers gave
one bang and collapsed.&nbsp; The Roman candles might have been
English rushlights.&nbsp; The Catherine wheels became mere
revolving glow-worms.&nbsp; The fiery serpents could not collect
among them the spirit of a tortoise.&nbsp; The set piece, a ship
at sea, showed one mast and the captain, and then went out.&nbsp;
One or two items did their duty, but this only served to render
the foolishness of the whole more striking.&nbsp; The little
girls giggled, the little boys chaffed, the aunts and cousins
said it was beautiful, the uncles inquired if it was all over,
and talked about supper and trains, the &ldquo;villagers and
retainers&rdquo; dispersed laughing, the indulgent mother said
&ldquo;never mind,&rdquo; and explained how well everything had
gone off yesterday; the clever little boy crept upstairs to his
room, and blubbered his heart out in the dark.</p>
<p>Hours later, when the crowd had forgotten him, he stole out
again into the garden.&nbsp; He sat down amid the ruins of his
hope, and wondered what could have caused the fiasco.&nbsp; Still
puzzled, he drew from his pocket a box of matches, and, lighting
one, he held it to the seared end of a rocket he had tried in
vain to light four hours ago.&nbsp; It smouldered for an instant,
then shot with a swish into the air and broke into a hundred
points of fire.&nbsp; He tried another and another with the same
result.&nbsp; He made a fresh attempt to fire the set
piece.&nbsp; Point by point the whole picture&mdash;minus the
captain and one mast&mdash;came out of the night, and stood
revealed in all the majesty of flame.&nbsp; Its sparks fell upon
the piled-up heap of candles, wheels, and rockets that a little
while before had obstinately refused to burn, and that, one after
another, had been thrown aside as useless.&nbsp; Now with the
night frost upon them, they leaped to light in one grand volcanic
eruption.&nbsp; And in front of the gorgeous spectacle he stood
with only one consolation&mdash;his mother&rsquo;s hand in
his.</p>
<p>The whole thing was a mystery to him at the time, but, as he
learned to know life better, he came to understand that it was
only one example of a solid but inexplicable fact, ruling all
human affairs&mdash;<i>your fireworks won&rsquo;t go off while
the crowd is around</i>.</p>
<p>Our brilliant repartees do not occur to us till the door is
closed upon us and we are alone in the street, or, as the French
would say, are coming down the stairs.&nbsp; Our after-dinner
oratory, that sounded so telling as we delivered it before the
looking-glass, falls strangely flat amidst the clinking of the
glasses.&nbsp; The passionate torrent of words we meant to pour
into her ear becomes a halting rigmarole, at which&mdash;small
blame to her&mdash;she only laughs.</p>
<p>I would, gentle Reader, you could hear the stories that I
meant to tell you.&nbsp; You judge me, of course, by the stories
of mine that you have read&mdash;by this sort of thing, perhaps;
but that is not just to me.&nbsp; The stories I have not told
you, that I am going to tell you one day, I would that you judge
me by those.</p>
<p>They are so beautiful; you will say so; over them, you will
laugh and cry with me.</p>
<p>They come into my brain unbidden, they clamour to be written,
yet when I take my pen in hand they are gone.&nbsp; It is as
though they were shy of publicity, as though they would say to
me&mdash;&ldquo;You alone, you shall read us, but you must not
write us; we are too real, too true.&nbsp; We are like the
thoughts you cannot speak.&nbsp; Perhaps a little later, when you
know more of life, then you shall tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to these in merit I would place, were I writing a
critical essay on myself, the stories I have begun to write and
that remain unfinished, why I cannot explain to myself.&nbsp;
They are good stories, most of them; better far than the stories
I have accomplished.&nbsp; Another time, perhaps, if you care to
listen, I will tell you the beginning of one or two and you shall
judge.&nbsp; Strangely enough, for I have always regarded myself
as a practical, commonsensed man, so many of these still-born
children of my mind I find, on looking through the cupboard where
their thin bodies lie, are ghost stories.&nbsp; I suppose the
hope of ghosts is with us all.&nbsp; The world grows somewhat
interesting to us heirs of all the ages.&nbsp; Year by year,
Science with broom and duster tears down the moth-worn tapestry,
forces the doors of the locked chambers, lets light into the
secret stairways, cleans out the dungeons, explores the hidden
passages&mdash;finding everywhere only dust.&nbsp; This echoing
old castle, the world, so full of mystery in the days when we
were children, is losing somewhat its charm for us as we grow
older.&nbsp; The king sleeps no longer in the hollow of the
hills.&nbsp; We have tunnelled through his mountain
chamber.&nbsp; We have shivered his beard with our pick.&nbsp; We
have driven the gods from Olympus.&nbsp; No wanderer through the
moonlit groves now fears or hopes the sweet, death-giving gleam
of Aphrodite&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Thor&rsquo;s hammer echoes not
among the peaks&mdash;&rsquo;tis but the thunder of the excursion
train.&nbsp; We have swept the woods of the fairies.&nbsp; We
have filtered the sea of its nymphs.&nbsp; Even the ghosts are
leaving us, chased by the Psychical Research Society.</p>
<p>Perhaps of all, they are the least, however, to be
regretted.&nbsp; They were dull old fellows, clanking their rusty
chains and groaning and sighing.&nbsp; Let them go.</p>
<p>And yet how interesting they might be, if only they
would.&nbsp; The old gentleman in the coat of mail, who lived in
King John&rsquo;s reign, who was murdered, so they say, on the
outskirts of the very wood I can see from my window as I
write&mdash;stabbed in the back, poor gentleman, as he was riding
home, his body flung into the moat that to this day is called
Tor&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; Dry enough it is now, and the primroses
love its steep banks; but a gloomy enough place in those days, no
doubt, with its twenty feet of stagnant water.&nbsp; Why does he
haunt the forest paths at night, as they tell me he does,
frightening the children out of their wits, blanching the faces
and stilling the laughter of the peasant lads and lasses,
slouching home from the village dance?&nbsp; Instead, why does he
not come up here and talk to me?&nbsp; He should have my
easy-chair and welcome, would he only be cheerful and
companionable.</p>
<p>What brave tales could he not tell me.&nbsp; He fought in the
first Crusade, heard the clarion voice of Peter, met the great
Godfrey face to face, stood, hand on sword-hilt, at Runny-mede,
perhaps.&nbsp; Better than a whole library of historical novels
would an evening&rsquo;s chat be with such a ghost.&nbsp; What
has he done with his eight hundred years of death? where has he
been? what has he seen?&nbsp; Maybe he has visited Mars; has
spoken to the strange spirits who can live in the liquid fires of
Jupiter.&nbsp; What has he learned of the great secret?&nbsp; Has
he found the truth? or is he, even as I, a wanderer still seeking
the unknown?</p>
<p>You, poor, pale, grey nun&mdash;they tell me that of midnights
one may see your white face peering from the ruined belfry
window, hear the clash of sword and shield among the cedar-trees
beneath.</p>
<p>It was very sad, I quite understand, my dear lady.&nbsp; Your
lovers both were killed, and you retired to a convent.&nbsp;
Believe me, I am sincerely sorry for you, but why waste every
night renewing the whole painful experience?&nbsp; Would it not
be better forgotten?&nbsp; Good Heavens, madam, suppose we living
folk were to spend our lives wailing and wringing our hands
because of the wrongs done to us when we were children?&nbsp; It
is all over now.&nbsp; Had he lived, and had you married him, you
might not have been happy.&nbsp; I do not wish to say anything
unkind, but marriages founded upon the sincerest mutual love have
sometimes turned out unfortunately, as you must surely know.</p>
<p>Do take my advice.&nbsp; Talk the matter over with the young
men themselves.&nbsp; Persuade them to shake hands and be
friends.&nbsp; Come in, all of you, out of the cold, and let us
have some reasonable talk.</p>
<p>Why seek you to trouble us, you poor pale ghosts?&nbsp; Are we
not your children?&nbsp; Be our wise friends.&nbsp; Tell me, how
loved the young men in your young days? how answered the
maidens?&nbsp; Has the world changed much, do you think?&nbsp;
Had you not new women even then? girls who hated the everlasting
tapestry frame and spinning-wheel?&nbsp; Your father&rsquo;s
servants, were they so much worse off than the freemen who live
in our East-end slums and sew slippers for fourteen hours a day
at a wage of nine shillings a week?&nbsp; Do you think Society
much improved during the last thousand years?&nbsp; Is it worse?
is it better? or is it, on the whole, about the same, save that
we call things by other names?&nbsp; Tell me, what have
<i>you</i> learned?</p>
<p>Yet might not familiarity breed contempt, even for ghosts.</p>
<p>One has had a tiring day&rsquo;s shooting.&nbsp; One is
looking forward to one&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp; As one opens the door,
however, a ghostly laugh comes from behind the bed-curtains, and
one groans inwardly, knowing what is in store for one: a two or
three hours&rsquo; talk with rowdy old Sir Lanval&mdash;he of the
lance.&nbsp; We know all his tales by heart, and he will shout
them.&nbsp; Suppose our aunt, from whom we have expectations, and
who sleeps in the next room, should wake and overhear!&nbsp; They
were fit and proper enough stories, no doubt, for the Round
Table, but we feel sure our aunt would not appreciate
them:&mdash;that story about Sir Agravain and the cooper&rsquo;s
wife! and he always will tell that story.</p>
<p>Or imagine the maid entering after dinner to say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you please, sir, here is the veiled
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, again!&rdquo; says your wife, looking up from her
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am; shall I show her up into the
bedroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better ask your master,&rdquo; is the
reply.&nbsp; The tone is suggestive of an unpleasant five minutes
so soon as the girl shall have withdrawn, but what are you to
do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, show her up,&rdquo; you say, and the girl
goes out, closing the door.</p>
<p>Your wife gathers her work together, and rises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; you ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sleep with the children,&rdquo; is the frigid
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will look so rude,&rdquo; you urge.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
must be civil to the poor thing; and you see it really is her
room, as one might say.&nbsp; She has always haunted
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very curious,&rdquo; returns the wife of your
bosom, still more icily, &ldquo;that she never haunts it except
when you are down here.&nbsp; Where she goes when you are in town
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is unjust.&nbsp; You cannot restrain your
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense you talk, Elizabeth,&rdquo; you reply;
&ldquo;I am only barely polite to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some men have such curious notions of
politeness,&rdquo; returns Elizabeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;But pray do
not let us quarrel.&nbsp; I am only anxious not to disturb
you.&nbsp; Two are company, you know.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t choose
to be the third, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;&nbsp; With which she
goes out.</p>
<p>And the veiled lady is still waiting for you up-stairs.&nbsp;
You wonder how long she will stop, also what will happen after
she is gone.</p>
<p>I fear there is no room for you, ghosts, in this our
world.&nbsp; You remember how they came to Hiawatha&mdash;the
ghosts of the departed loved ones.&nbsp; He had prayed to them
that they would come back to him to comfort him, so one day they
crept into his wigwam, sat in silence round his fireside, chilled
the air for Hiawatha, froze the smiles of Laughing Water.</p>
<p>There is no room for you, oh you poor pale ghosts, in this our
world.&nbsp; Do not trouble us.&nbsp; Let us forget.&nbsp; You,
stout elderly matron, your thin locks turning grey, your eyes
grown weak, your chin more ample, your voice harsh with much
scolding and complaining, needful, alas! to household management,
I pray you leave me.&nbsp; I loved you while you lived.&nbsp; How
sweet, how beautiful you were.&nbsp; I see you now in your white
frock among the apple-blossom.&nbsp; But you are dead, and your
ghost disturbs my dreams.&nbsp; I would it haunted me not.</p>
<p>You, dull old fellow, looking out at me from the glass at
which I shave, why do you haunt me?&nbsp; You are the ghost of a
bright lad I once knew well.&nbsp; He might have done much, had
he lived.&nbsp; I always had faith in him.&nbsp; Why do you haunt
me?&nbsp; I would rather think of him as I remember him.&nbsp; I
never imagined he would make such a poor ghost.</p>
<h2><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>ON THE
PREPARATION AND EMPLOYMENT OF LOVE PHILTRES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Occasionally</span> a friend will ask me
some such question as this, Do you prefer dark women or
fair?&nbsp; Another will say, Do you like tall women or
short?&nbsp; A third, Do you think light-hearted women, or
serious, the more agreeable company?&nbsp; I find myself in the
position that, once upon a time, overtook a certain charming
young lady of taste who was asked by an anxious parent, the years
mounting, and the family expenditure not decreasing, which of the
numerous and eligible young men, then paying court to her, she
liked the best.&nbsp; She replied, that was her difficulty.&nbsp;
She could not make up her mind which she liked the best.&nbsp;
They were all so nice.&nbsp; She could not possibly select one to
the exclusion of all the others.&nbsp; What she would have liked
would have been to marry the lot, but that, she presumed, was
impracticable.</p>
<p>I feel I resemble that young lady, not so much, perhaps, in
charm and beauty as indecision of mind, when questions such as
the above are put to me.&nbsp; It is as if one were asked
one&rsquo;s favourite food.&nbsp; There are times when one
fancies an egg with one&rsquo;s tea.&nbsp; On other occasions one
dreams of a kipper.&nbsp; To-day one clamours for lobsters.&nbsp;
To-morrow one feels one never wishes to see a lobster again; one
determines to settle down, for a time, to a diet of bread and
milk and rice-pudding.&nbsp; Asked suddenly to say whether I
preferred ices to soup, or beefsteaks to caviare, I should be
nonplussed.</p>
<p>I like tall women and short, dark women and fair, merry women
and grave.</p>
<p>Do not blame me, Ladies, the fault lies with you.&nbsp; Every
right-thinking man is an universal lover; how could it be
otherwise?&nbsp; You are so diverse, yet each so charming of your
kind; and a man&rsquo;s heart is large.&nbsp; You have no idea,
fair Reader, how large a man&rsquo;s heart is: that is his
trouble&mdash;sometimes yours.</p>
<p>May I not admire the daring tulip, because I love also the
modest lily?&nbsp; May I not press a kiss upon the sweet violet,
because the scent of the queenly rose is precious to me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; I hear the Rose reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you can see anything in her, you shall have nothing to
do with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you care for that bold creature,&rdquo; says the
Lily, trembling, &ldquo;you are not the man I took you for.&nbsp;
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your baby-faced Violet,&rdquo; cries the Tulip,
with a toss of her haughty head.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are just fitted
for each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when I return to the Lily, she tells me that she cannot
trust me.&nbsp; She has watched me with those others.&nbsp; She
knows me for a gad-about.&nbsp; Her gentle face is full of
pain.</p>
<p>So I must live unloved merely because I love too much.</p>
<p>My wonder is that young men ever marry.&nbsp; The difficulty
of selection must be appalling.&nbsp; I walked the other evening
in Hyde Park.&nbsp; The band of the Life Guards played
heart-lifting music, and the vast crowd were basking in a sweet
enjoyment such as rarely woos the English toiler.&nbsp; I
strolled among them, and my attention was chiefly drawn towards
the women.&nbsp; The great majority of them were, I suppose,
shop-girls, milliners, and others belonging to the lower
middle-class.&nbsp; They had put on their best frocks, their
bonniest hats, their newest gloves.&nbsp; They sat or walked in
twos and threes, chattering and preening, as happy as young
sparrows on a clothes line.&nbsp; And what a handsome crowd they
made!&nbsp; I have seen German crowds, I have seen French crowds,
I have seen Italian crowds; but nowhere do you find such a
proportion of pretty women as among the English
middle-class.&nbsp; Three women out of every four were worth
looking at, every other woman was pretty, while every fourth, one
might say without exaggeration, was beautiful.&nbsp; As I passed
to and fro the idea occurred to me: suppose I were an
unprejudiced young bachelor, free from predilection, looking for
a wife; and let me suppose&mdash;it is only a fancy&mdash;that
all these girls were ready and willing to accept me.&nbsp; I have
only to choose!&nbsp; I grew bewildered.&nbsp; There were fair
girls, to look at whom was fatal; dark girls that set one&rsquo;s
heart aflame; girls with red gold hair and grave grey eyes, whom
one would follow to the confines of the universe; baby-faced
girls that one longed to love and cherish; girls with noble
faces, whom a man might worship; laughing girls, with whom one
could dance through life gaily; serious girls, with whom life
would be sweet and good, domestic-looking girls&mdash;one felt
such would make delightful wives; they would cook, and sew, and
make of home a pleasant, peaceful place.&nbsp; Then
wicked-looking girls came by, at the stab of whose bold eyes all
orthodox thoughts were put to a flight, whose laughter turned the
world into a mad carnival; girls one could mould; girls from whom
one could learn; sad girls one wanted to comfort; merry girls who
would cheer one; little girls, big girls, queenly girls,
fairy-like girls.</p>
<p>Suppose a young man had to select his wife in this fashion
from some twenty or thirty thousand; or that a girl were suddenly
confronted with eighteen thousand eligible young bachelors, and
told to take the one she wanted and be quick about it?&nbsp;
Neither boy nor girl would ever marry.&nbsp; Fate is kinder to
us.&nbsp; She understands, and assists us.&nbsp; In the hall of a
Paris hotel I once overheard one lady asking another to recommend
her a milliner&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the Maison Nouvelle,&rdquo; advised the
questioned lady, with enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have the
largest selection there of any place in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know they have,&rdquo; replied the first lady,
&ldquo;that is just why I don&rsquo;t mean to go there.&nbsp; It
confuses me.&nbsp; If I see six bonnets I can tell the one I want
in five minutes.&nbsp; If I see six hundred I come away without
any bonnet at all.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know a little
shop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fate takes the young man or the young woman aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into this village, my dear,&rdquo; says Fate;
&ldquo;into this by-street of this salubrious suburb, into this
social circle, into this church, into this chapel.&nbsp; Now, my
dear boy, out of these seventeen young ladies, which will you
have?&mdash;out of these thirteen young men, which would you like
for your very own, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, miss, I am sorry, but I am not able to show you our
up-stairs department to-day, the lift is not working.&nbsp; But I
am sure we shall be able to find something in this room to suit
you.&nbsp; Just look round, my dear, perhaps you will see
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I cannot show you the stock in the next room,
we never take that out except for our very special
customers.&nbsp; We keep our most expensive goods in that
room.&nbsp; (Draw that curtain, Miss Circumstance, please.&nbsp;
I have told you of that before.)&nbsp; Now, sir, wouldn&rsquo;t
you like this one?&nbsp; This colour is quite the rage this
season; we are getting rid of quite a lot of these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>, sir!&nbsp; Well, of course, it would not do
for every one&rsquo;s taste to be the same.&nbsp; Perhaps
something dark would suit you better.&nbsp; Bring out those two
brunettes, Miss Circumstance.&nbsp; Charming girls both of them,
don&rsquo;t you think so, sir?&nbsp; I should say the taller one
for you, sir.&nbsp; Just one moment, sir, allow me.&nbsp; Now,
what do you think of that, sir? might have been made to fit you,
I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; <i>You prefer the shorter one</i>.&nbsp;
Certainly, sir, no difference to us at all.&nbsp; Both are the
same price.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing like having one&rsquo;s
own fancy, I always say.&nbsp; <i>No</i>, sir, I cannot put her
aside for you, we never do that.&nbsp; Indeed, there&rsquo;s
rather a run on brunettes just at present.&nbsp; I had a
gentleman in only this morning, looking at this particular one,
and he is going to call again to-night.&nbsp; Indeed, I am not at
all sure&mdash;Oh, of course, sir, if you like to settle on this
one now, that ends the matter.&nbsp; (Put those others away, Miss
Circumstance, please, and mark this one sold.)&nbsp; I feel sure
you&rsquo;ll like her, sir, when you get her home.&nbsp; Thank
<i>you</i>, sir.&nbsp; Good-morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, miss, have <i>you</i> seen anything you
fancy?&nbsp; <i>Yes</i>, miss, this is all we have at anything
near your price.&nbsp; (Shut those other cupboards, Miss
Circumstance; never show more stock than you are obliged to, it
only confuses customers.&nbsp; How often am I to tell you
that?)&nbsp; <i>Yes</i>, miss, you are quite right, there
<i>is</i> a slight blemish.&nbsp; They all have some slight
flaw.&nbsp; The makers say they can&rsquo;t help
it&mdash;it&rsquo;s in the material.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not once in
a season we get a perfect specimen; and when we do ladies
don&rsquo;t seem to care for it.&nbsp; Most of our customers
prefer a little faultiness.&nbsp; They say it gives
character.&nbsp; Now, look at this, miss.&nbsp; This sort of
thing wears very well, warm and quiet.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d like one
with more colour in it?&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; Miss Circumstance,
reach me down the art patterns.&nbsp; <i>No</i>, miss, we
don&rsquo;t guarantee any of them over the year, so much depends
on how you use them.&nbsp; <i>Oh yes</i>, miss, they&rsquo;ll
stand a fair amount of wear.&nbsp; People do tell you the quieter
patterns last longer; but my experience is that one is much the
same as another.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s really no telling any of
them until you come to try them.&nbsp; We never recommend one
more than another.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a lot of chance about
these goods, it&rsquo;s in the nature of them.&nbsp; What I
always say to ladies is&mdash;&lsquo;Please yourself, it&rsquo;s
you who have got to wear it; and it&rsquo;s no good having an
article you start by not liking.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>Yes</i>, miss,
it <i>is</i> pretty and it looks well against you: it does
indeed.&nbsp; Thank you, miss.&nbsp; Put that one aside, Miss
Circumstance, please.&nbsp; See that it doesn&rsquo;t get mixed
up with the unsold stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a useful philtre, the juice of that small western
flower, that Oberon drops upon our eyelids as we sleep.&nbsp; It
solves all difficulties in a trice.&nbsp; Why of course Helena is
the fairer.&nbsp; Compare her with Hermia!&nbsp; Compare the
raven with the dove!&nbsp; How could we ever have doubted for a
moment?&nbsp; Bottom is an angel, Bottom is as wise as he is
handsome.&nbsp; Oh, Oberon, we thank you for that drug.&nbsp;
Matilda Jane is a goddess; Matilda Jane is a queen; no woman ever
born of Eve was like Matilda Jane.&nbsp; The little pimple on her
nose&mdash;her little, sweet, tip-tilted nose&mdash;how beautiful
it is.&nbsp; Her bright eyes flash with temper now and then; how
piquant is a temper in a woman.&nbsp; William is a dear old
stupid, how lovable stupid men can be&mdash;especially when wise
enough to love us.&nbsp; William does not shine in conversation;
how we hate a magpie of a man.&nbsp; William&rsquo;s chin is what
is called receding, just the sort of chin a beard looks well
on.&nbsp; Bless you, Oberon darling, for that drug; rub it on our
eyelids once again.&nbsp; Better let us have a bottle, Oberon, to
keep by us.</p>
<p>Oberon, Oberon, what are you thinking of?&nbsp; You have given
the bottle to Puck.&nbsp; Take it away from him, quick.&nbsp;
Lord help us all if that Imp has the bottle.&nbsp; Lord save us
from Puck while we sleep.</p>
<p>Or may we, fairy Oberon, regard your lotion as an eye-opener,
rather than as an eye-closer?&nbsp; You remember the story the
storks told the children, of the little girl who was a toad by
day, only her sweet dark eyes being left to her.&nbsp; But at
night, when the Prince clasped her close to his breast, lo! again
she became the king&rsquo;s daughter, fairest and fondest of
women.&nbsp; There be many royal ladies in Marshland, with bad
complexion and thin straight hair, and the silly princes sneer
and ride away to woo some kitchen wench decked out in
queen&rsquo;s apparel.&nbsp; Lucky the prince upon whose eyelids
Oberon has dropped the magic philtre.</p>
<p>In the gallery of a minor Continental town I have forgotten,
hangs a picture that lives with me.&nbsp; The painting I cannot
recall, whether good or bad; artists must forgive me for
remembering only the subject.&nbsp; It shows a man, crucified by
the roadside.&nbsp; No martyr he.&nbsp; If ever a man deserved
hanging it was this one.&nbsp; So much the artist has made
clear.&nbsp; The face, even under its mask of agony, is an evil,
treacherous face.&nbsp; A peasant girl clings to the cross; she
stands tip-toe upon a patient donkey, straining her face upward
for the half-dead man to stoop and kiss her lips.</p>
<p>Thief, coward, blackguard, they are stamped upon his face, but
<i>under</i> the face, under the evil outside?&nbsp; Is there no
remnant of manhood&mdash;nothing tender, nothing, true?&nbsp; A
woman has crept to the cross to kiss him: no evidence in his
favour, my Lord?&nbsp; Love is blind-aye, to our faults.&nbsp;
Heaven help us all; Love&rsquo;s eyes would be sore indeed if it
were not so.&nbsp; But for the good that is in us her eyes are
keen.&nbsp; You, crucified blackguard, stand forth.&nbsp; A
hundred witnesses have given their evidence against you.&nbsp;
Are there none to give evidence for him?&nbsp; A woman, great
Judge, who loved him.&nbsp; Let her speak.</p>
<p>But I am wandering far from Hyde Park and its show of
girls.</p>
<p>They passed and re-passed me, laughing, smiling,
talking.&nbsp; Their eyes were bright with merry thoughts; their
voices soft and musical.&nbsp; They were pleased, and they wanted
to please.&nbsp; Some were married, some had evidently reasonable
expectations of being married; the rest hoped to be.&nbsp; And
we, myself, and some ten thousand other young men.&nbsp; I repeat
it&mdash;myself and some ten thousand other young men; for who
among us ever thinks of himself but as a young man?&nbsp; It is
the world that ages, not we.&nbsp; The children cease their
playing and grow grave, the lasses&rsquo; eyes are dimmer.&nbsp;
The hills are a little steeper, the milestones, surely, further
apart.&nbsp; The songs the young men sing are less merry than the
songs we used to sing.&nbsp; The days have grown a little colder,
the wind a little keener.&nbsp; The wine has lost its flavour
somewhat; the new humour is not like the old.&nbsp; The other
boys are becoming dull and prosy; but we are not changed.&nbsp;
It is the world that is growing old.&nbsp; Therefore, I brave
your thoughtless laughter, youthful Reader, and repeat that we,
myself and some ten thousand other young men, walked among these
sweet girls; and, using our boyish eyes, were fascinated,
charmed, and captivated.&nbsp; How delightful to spend our lives
with them, to do little services for them that would call up
these bright smiles.&nbsp; How pleasant to jest with them, and
hear their flute-like laughter, to console them and read their
grateful eyes.&nbsp; Really life is a pleasant thing, and the
idea of marriage undoubtedly originated in the brain of a kindly
Providence.</p>
<p>We smiled back at them, and we made way for them; we rose from
our chairs with a polite, &ldquo;Allow me, miss,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, I prefer standing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a delightful evening, is it not?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
perhaps&mdash;for what harm was there?&mdash;we dropped into
conversation with these chance fellow-passengers upon the stream
of life.&nbsp; There were those among us&mdash;bold daring
spirits&mdash;who even went to the length of mild
flirtation.&nbsp; Some of us knew some of them, and in such happy
case there followed interchange of pretty pleasantries.&nbsp;
Your English middle-class young man and woman are not adepts at
the game of flirtation.&nbsp; I will confess that our methods
were, perhaps, elephantine, that we may have grown a trifle noisy
as the evening wore on.&nbsp; But we meant no evil; we did but
our best to enjoy ourselves, to give enjoyment, to make the too
brief time, pass gaily.</p>
<p>And then my thoughts travelled to small homes in distant
suburbs, and these bright lads and lasses round me came to look
older and more careworn.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp; Are not
old faces sweet when looked at by old eyes a little dimmed by
love, and are not care and toil but the parents of peace and
joy?</p>
<p>But as I drew nearer, I saw that many of the faces were seared
with sour and angry looks, and the voices that rose round me
sounded surly and captious.&nbsp; The pretty compliment and
praise had changed to sneers and scoldings.&nbsp; The dimpled
smile had wrinkled to a frown.&nbsp; There seemed so little
desire to please, so great a determination not to be pleased.</p>
<p>And the flirtations!&nbsp; Ah me, they had forgotten how to
flirt!&nbsp; Oh, the pity of it!&nbsp; All the jests were bitter,
all the little services were given grudgingly.&nbsp; The air
seemed to have grown chilly.&nbsp; A darkness had come over all
things.</p>
<p>And then I awoke to reality, and found I had been sitting in
my chair longer than I had intended.&nbsp; The band-stand was
empty, the sun had set; I rose and made my way home through the
scattered crowd.</p>
<p>Nature is so callous.&nbsp; The Dame irritates one at times by
her devotion to her one idea, the propagation of the species.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Multiply and be fruitful; let my world be ever more and
more peopled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For this she trains and fashions her young girls, models them
with cunning hand, paints them with her wonderful red and white,
crowns them with her glorious hair, teaches them to smile and
laugh, trains their voices into music, sends them out into the
world to captivate, to enslave us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how beautiful she is, my lad,&rdquo; says the
cunning old woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take her; build your little nest
with her in your pretty suburb; work for her and live for her;
enable her to keep the little ones that I will send.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to her, old hundred-breasted Artemis whispers, &ldquo;Is
he not a bonny lad?&nbsp; See how he loves you, how devoted he is
to you!&nbsp; He will work for you and make you happy; he will
build your home for you.&nbsp; You will be the mother of his
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we take each other by the hand, full of hope and love, and
from that hour Mother Nature has done with us.&nbsp; Let the
wrinkles come; let our voices grow harsh; let the fire she
lighted in our hearts die out; let the foolish selfishness we
both thought we had put behind us for ever creep back to us,
bringing unkindness and indifference, angry thoughts and cruel
words into our lives.&nbsp; What cares she?&nbsp; She has caught
us, and chained us to her work.&nbsp; She is our universal
mother-in-law.&nbsp; She has done the match-making; for the rest,
she leaves it to ourselves.&nbsp; We can love or we can fight; it
is all one to her, confound her.</p>
<p>I wonder sometimes if good temper might not be taught.&nbsp;
In business we use no harsh language, say no unkind things to one
another.&nbsp; The shopkeeper, leaning across the counter, is all
smiles and affability, he might put up his shutters were he
otherwise.&nbsp; The commercial gent, no doubt, thinks the
ponderous shopwalker an ass, but refrains from telling him
so.&nbsp; Hasty tempers are banished from the City.&nbsp; Can we
not see that it is just as much to our interest to banish them
from Tooting and Hampstead?</p>
<p>The young man who sat in the chair next to me, how carefully
he wrapped the cloak round the shoulders of the little milliner
beside him.&nbsp; And when she said she was tired of sitting
still, how readily he sprang from his chair to walk with her,
though it was evident he was very comfortable where he was.&nbsp;
And she!&nbsp; She had laughed at his jokes; they were not very
clever jokes, they were not very new.&nbsp; She had probably read
them herself months before in her own particular weekly
journal.&nbsp; Yet the harmless humbug made him happy.&nbsp; I
wonder if ten years hence she will laugh at such old humour, if
ten years hence he will take such clumsy pains to put her cape
about her.&nbsp; Experience shakes her head, and is amused at my
question.</p>
<p>I would have evening classes for the teaching of temper to
married couples, only I fear the institution would languish for
lack of pupils.&nbsp; The husbands would recommend their wives to
attend, generously offering to pay the fee as a birthday
present.&nbsp; The wife would be indignant at the suggestion of
good money being thus wasted.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, John, dear,&rdquo;
she would unselfishly reply, &ldquo;you need the lessons more
than I do.&nbsp; It would be a shame for me to take them away
from you,&rdquo; and they would wrangle upon the subject for the
rest of the day.</p>
<p>Oh! the folly of it.&nbsp; We pack our hamper for life&rsquo;s
picnic with such pains.&nbsp; We spend so much, we work so
hard.&nbsp; We make choice pies, we cook prime joints, we prepare
so carefully the mayonnaise, we mix with loving hands the salad,
we cram the basket to the lid with every delicacy we can think
of.&nbsp; Everything to make the picnic a success is there except
the salt.&nbsp; Ah! woe is me, we forget the salt.&nbsp; We slave
at our desks, in our workshops, to make a home for those we love;
we give up our pleasures, we give up our rest.&nbsp; We toil in
our kitchen from morning till night, and we render the whole
feast tasteless for want of a ha&rsquo;porth of salt&mdash;for
want of a soupcon of amiability, for want of a handful of kindly
words, a touch of caress, a pinch of courtesy.</p>
<p>Who does not know that estimable housewife, working from eight
till twelve to keep the house in what she calls order?&nbsp; She
is so good a woman, so untiring, so unselfish, so conscientious,
so irritating.&nbsp; Her rooms are so clean, her servants so well
managed, her children so well dressed, her dinners so well
cooked; the whole house so uninviting.&nbsp; Everything about her
is in apple-pie order, and everybody wretched.</p>
<p>My good Madam, you polish your tables, you scour your kettles,
but the most valuable piece of furniture in the whole house you
are letting to rack and ruin for want of a little pains.&nbsp;
You will find it in your own room, my dear Lady, in front of your
own mirror.&nbsp; It is getting shabby and dingy, old-looking
before its time; the polish is rubbed off it, Madam, it is losing
its brightness and charm.&nbsp; Do you remember when he first
brought it home, how proud he was of it?&nbsp; Do you think you
have used it well, knowing how he valued it?&nbsp; A little less
care of your pots and your pans, Madam, a little more of yourself
were wiser.&nbsp; Polish yourself up, Madam; you had a pretty wit
once, a pleasant laugh, a conversation that was not confined
exclusively to the short-comings of servants, the wrong-doings of
tradesmen.&nbsp; My dear Madam, we do not live on spotless linen,
and crumbless carpets.&nbsp; Hunt out that bundle of old letters
you keep tied up in faded ribbon at the back of your bureau
drawer&mdash;a pity you don&rsquo;t read them oftener.&nbsp; He
did not enthuse about your cuffs and collars, gush over the
neatness of your darning.&nbsp; It was your tangled hair he raved
about, your sunny smile (we have not seen it for some years,
Madam&mdash;the fault of the Cook and the Butcher, I presume),
your little hands, your rosebud mouth&mdash;it has lost its
shape, Madam, of late.&nbsp; Try a little less scolding of Mary
Ann, and practise a laugh once a day: you might get back the
dainty curves.&nbsp; It would be worth trying.&nbsp; It was a
pretty mouth once.</p>
<p>Who invented that mischievous falsehood that the way to a
man&rsquo;s heart was through his stomach?&nbsp; How many a silly
woman, taking it for truth, has let love slip out of the parlour,
while she was busy in the kitchen.&nbsp; Of course, if you were
foolish enough to marry a pig, I suppose you must be content to
devote your life to the preparation of hog&rsquo;s-wash.&nbsp;
But are you sure that he <i>is</i> a pig?&nbsp; If by any chance
he be not?&mdash;then, Madam, you are making a grievous
mistake.&nbsp; My dear Lady, you are too modest.&nbsp; If I may
say so without making you unduly conceited, even at the
dinner-table itself, you are of much more importance than the
mutton.&nbsp; Courage, Madam, be not afraid to tilt a lance even
with your own cook.&nbsp; You can be more piquant than the sauce
<i>&agrave; la Tartare</i>, more soothing surely than the melted
butter.&nbsp; There was a time when he would not have known
whether he was eating beef or pork with you the other side of the
table.&nbsp; Whose fault is it?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think so poorly
of us.&nbsp; We are not ascetics, neither are we all gourmets:
most of us plain men, fond of our dinner, as a healthy man should
be, but fonder still of our sweethearts and wives, let us
hope.&nbsp; Try us.&nbsp; A moderately-cooked dinner&mdash;let us
even say a not-too-well-cooked dinner, with you looking your
best, laughing and talking gaily and cleverly&mdash;as you can,
you know&mdash;makes a pleasanter meal for us, after the
day&rsquo;s work is done, than that same dinner, cooked to
perfection, with you silent, jaded, and anxious, your pretty hair
untidy, your pretty face wrinkled with care concerning the sole,
with anxiety regarding the omelette.</p>
<p>My poor Martha, be not troubled about so many things.&nbsp;
<i>You</i> are the one thing needful&mdash;if the bricks and
mortar are to be a home.&nbsp; See to it that <i>you</i> are well
served up, that <i>you</i> are done to perfection, that
<i>you</i> are tender and satisfying, that <i>you</i> are worth
sitting down to.&nbsp; We wanted a wife, a comrade, a friend; not
a cook and a nurse on the cheap.</p>
<p>But of what use is it to talk? the world will ever follow its
own folly.&nbsp; When I think of all the good advice that I have
given it, and of the small result achieved, I confess I grow
discouraged.&nbsp; I was giving good advice to a lady only the
other day.&nbsp; I was instructing her as to the proper treatment
of aunts.&nbsp; She was sucking a lead-pencil, a thing I am
always telling her not to do.&nbsp; She took it out of her mouth
to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know how everybody ought to do
everything,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>There are times when it is necessary to sacrifice one&rsquo;s
modesty to one&rsquo;s duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does Mama know how everybody ought to do
everything?&rdquo; was the second question.</p>
<p>My conviction on this point was by no means so strong, but for
domestic reasons I again sacrificed myself to expediency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;and take that
pencil out of your mouth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve told you of that
before.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll swallow it one day, and then
you&rsquo;ll get perichondritis and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She appeared to be solving a problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All grown-up people seem to know everything,&rdquo; she
summarized.</p>
<p>There are times when I doubt if children are as simple as they
look.&nbsp; If it be sheer stupidity that prompts them to make
remarks of this character, one should pity them, and seek to
improve them.&nbsp; But if it be not stupidity? well then, one
should still seek to improve them, but by a different method.</p>
<p>The other morning I overheard the nurse talking to this
particular specimen.&nbsp; The woman is a most worthy creature,
and she was imparting to the child some really sound
advice.&nbsp; She was in the middle of an unexceptional
exhortation concerning the virtue of silence, when Dorothea
interrupted her with&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do be quiet, Nurse.&nbsp; I never get a
moment&rsquo;s peace from your chatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such an interruption discourages a woman who is trying to do
her duty.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday evening she was unhappy.&nbsp; Myself, I think
that rhubarb should never be eaten before April, and then never
with lemonade.&nbsp; Her mother read her a homily upon the
subject of pain.&nbsp; It was impressed upon her that we must be
patient, that we must put up with the trouble that God sends
us.&nbsp; Dorothea would descend to details, as children
will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we put up with the cod-liver oil that God sends
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, decidedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with the nurses that God sends us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; and be thankful that you&rsquo;ve got them,
some little girls haven&rsquo;t any nurse.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t
talk so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Friday I found the mother in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;only
Baby.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s such a strange child.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
make her out at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she been up to now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she will argue, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She has that failing.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where she gets
it from, but she&rsquo;s got it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she made me cross; and, to punish her, I told her
she shouldn&rsquo;t take her doll&rsquo;s perambulator out with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she didn&rsquo;t say anything then, but so soon
as I was outside the door, I heard her talking to
herself&mdash;you know her way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;I must be patient.&nbsp; I must put up
with the mother God has sent me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lunches down-stairs on Sundays.&nbsp; We have her with us
once a week to give her the opportunity of studying manners and
behaviour.&nbsp; Milson had dropped in, and we were discussing
politics.&nbsp; I was interested, and, pushing my plate aside,
leant forward with my elbows on the table.&nbsp; Dorothea has a
habit of talking to herself in a high-pitched whisper capable of
being heard above an Adelphi love scene.&nbsp; I heard her
say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must sit up straight.&nbsp; I mustn&rsquo;t sprawl
with my elbows on the table.&nbsp; It is only common, vulgar
people behave that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked across at her; she was sitting most correctly, and
appeared to be contemplating something a thousand miles
away.&nbsp; We had all of us been lounging!&nbsp; We sat up
stiffly, and conversation flagged.</p>
<p>Of course we made a joke of it after the child was gone.&nbsp;
But somehow it didn&rsquo;t seem to be <i>our</i> joke.</p>
<p>I wish I could recollect my childhood.&nbsp; I should so like
to know if children are as simple as they can look.</p>

THE DELIGHTS AND BENEFITS OF SLAVERY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> study window looks down upon
Hyde Park, and often, to quote the familiar promise of each new
magazine, it amuses and instructs me to watch from my tower the
epitome of human life that passes to and fro beneath.&nbsp; At
the opening of the gates, creeps in the woman of the
streets.&nbsp; Her pitiful work for the time being is over.&nbsp;
Shivering in the chill dawn, she passes to her brief rest.&nbsp;
Poor Slave!&nbsp; Lured to the galley&rsquo;s lowest deck, then
chained there.&nbsp; Civilization, tricked fool, they say has
need of such.&nbsp; You serve as the dogs of Eastern towns.&nbsp;
But at least, it seems to me, we need not spit on you.&nbsp; Home
to your kennel!&nbsp; Perchance, if the Gods be kind, they may
send you dreams of a cleanly hearth, where you lie with a silver
collar round your neck.</p>
<p>Next comes the labourer&mdash;the hewer of wood, the drawer of
water&mdash;slouching wearily to his toil; sleep clinging still
about his leaden eyes, his pittance of food carried tied up in a
dish-clout.&nbsp; The first stroke of the hour clangs from Big
Ben.&nbsp; Haste thee, fellow-slave, lest the overseer&rsquo;s
whip, &ldquo;Out, we will have no lie-a-beds here,&rdquo; descend
upon thy patient back.</p>
<p>Later, the artisan, with his bag of tools across his
shoulder.&nbsp; He, too, listens fearfully to the chiming of the
bells.&nbsp; For him also there hangs ready the whip.</p>
<p>After him, the shop boy and the shop girl, making love as they
walk, not to waste time.&nbsp; And after these the slaves of the
desk and of the warehouse, employers and employed, clerks and
tradesmen, office boys and merchants.&nbsp; To your places,
slaves of all ranks.&nbsp; Get you unto your burdens.</p>
<p>Now, laughing and shouting as they run, the children, the sons
and daughters of the slaves.&nbsp; Be industrious, little
children, and learn your lessons, that when the time comes you
may be ready to take from our hands the creaking oar, to slip
into our seat at the roaring loom.&nbsp; For we shall not be
slaves for ever, little children.&nbsp; It is the good law of the
land.&nbsp; So many years in the galleys, so many years in the
fields; then we can claim our freedom.&nbsp; Then we shall go,
little children, back to the land of our birth.&nbsp; And you we
must leave behind us to take up the tale of our work.&nbsp; So,
off to your schools, little children, and learn to be good little
slaves.</p>
<p>Next, pompous and sleek, come the educated
slaves&mdash;journalists, doctors, judges, and poets; the
attorney, the artist, the player, the priest.&nbsp; They likewise
scurry across the Park, looking anxiously from time to time at
their watches, lest they be late for their appointments; thinking
of the rates and taxes to be earned, of the bonnets to be paid
for, the bills to be met.&nbsp; The best scourged, perhaps, of
all, these slaves.&nbsp; The cat reserved for them has fifty
tails in place of merely two or three.&nbsp; Work, you higher
middle-class slave, or you shall come down to the smoking of
twopenny cigars; harder yet, or you shall drink shilling claret;
harder, or you shall lose your carriage and ride in a penny bus;
your wife&rsquo;s frocks shall be of last year&rsquo;s fashion;
your trousers shall bag at the knees; from Kensington you shall
be banished to Kilburn, if the tale of your bricks run
short.&nbsp; Oh, a many-thonged whip is yours, my genteel
brother.</p>
<p>The slaves of fashion are the next to pass beneath me in
review.&nbsp; They are dressed and curled with infinite
pains.&nbsp; The liveried, pampered footman these, kept more for
show than use; but their senseless tasks none the less labour to
them.&nbsp; Here must they come every day, merry or sad.&nbsp; By
this gravel path and no other must they walk; these phrases shall
they use when they speak to one another.&nbsp; For an hour they
must go slowly up and down upon a bicycle from Hyde Park Corner
to the Magazine and back.&nbsp; And these clothes must they wear;
their gloves of this colour, their neck-ties of this
pattern.&nbsp; In the afternoon they must return again, this time
in a carriage, dressed in another livery, and for an hour they
must pass slowly to and fro in foolish procession.&nbsp; For
dinner they must don yet another livery, and after dinner they
must stand about at dreary social functions till with weariness
and boredom their heads feel dropping from their shoulders.</p>
<p>With the evening come the slaves back from their work:
barristers, thinking out their eloquent appeals; school-boys,
conning their dog-eared grammars; City men, planning their
schemes; the wearers of motley, cudgelling their poor brains for
fresh wit with which to please their master; shop boys and shop
girls, silent now as, together, they plod homeward; the artisan;
the labourer.&nbsp; Two or three hours you shall have to
yourselves, slaves, to think and love and play, if you be not too
tired to think, or love, or play.&nbsp; Then to your litter, that
you may be ready for the morrow&rsquo;s task.</p>
<p>The twilight deepens into dark; there comes back the woman of
the streets.&nbsp; As the shadows, she rounds the City&rsquo;s
day.&nbsp; Work strikes its tent.&nbsp; Evil creeps from its
peering place.</p>
<p>So we labour, driven by the whip of necessity, an army of
slaves.&nbsp; If we do not our work, the whip descends upon us;
only the pain we feel in our stomach instead of on our
back.&nbsp; And because of that, we call ourselves free men.</p>
<p>Some few among us bravely struggle to be really free: they are
our tramps and outcasts.&nbsp; We well-behaved slaves shrink from
them, for the wages of freedom in this world are vermin and
starvation.&nbsp; We can live lives worth living only by placing
the collar round our neck.</p>
<p>There are times when one asks oneself: Why this endless
labour?&nbsp; Why this building of houses, this cooking of food,
this making of clothes?&nbsp; Is the ant so much more to be
envied than the grasshopper, because she spends her life in
grubbing and storing, and can spare no time for singing?&nbsp;
Why this complex instinct, driving us to a thousand labours to
satisfy a thousand desires?&nbsp; We have turned the world into a
workshop to provide ourselves with toys.&nbsp; To purchase luxury
we have sold our ease.</p>
<p>Oh, Children of Israel! why were ye not content in your
wilderness?&nbsp; It seems to have been a pattern
wilderness.&nbsp; For you, a simple wholesome food, ready cooked,
was provided.&nbsp; You took no thought for rent and taxes; you
had no poor among you&mdash;no poor-rate collectors.&nbsp; You
suffered not from indigestion, nor the hundred ills that follow
over-feeding; an omer for every man was your portion, neither
more nor less.&nbsp; You knew not you had a liver.&nbsp; Doctors
wearied you not with their theories, their physics, and their
bills.&nbsp; You were neither landowners nor leaseholders,
neither shareholders nor debenture holders.&nbsp; The weather and
the market reports troubled you not.&nbsp; The lawyer was unknown
to you; you wanted no advice; you had nought to quarrel about
with your neighbour.&nbsp; No riches were yours for the moth and
rust to damage.&nbsp; Your yearly income and expenditure you knew
would balance to a fraction.&nbsp; Your wife and children were
provided for.&nbsp; Your old age caused you no anxiety; you knew
you would always have enough to live upon in comfort.&nbsp; Your
funeral, a simple and tasteful affair, would be furnished by the
tribe.&nbsp; And yet, poor, foolish child, fresh from the
Egyptian brickfield, you could not rest satisfied.&nbsp; You
hungered for the fleshpots, knowing well what flesh-pots entail:
the cleaning of the flesh-pots, the forging of the flesh-pots,
the hewing of wood to make the fires for the boiling of the
flesh-pots, the breeding of beasts to fill the pots, the growing
of fodder to feed the beasts to fill the pots.</p>
<p>All the labour of our life is centred round our
flesh-pots.&nbsp; On the altar of the flesh-pot we sacrifice our
leisure, our peace of mind.&nbsp; For a mess of pottage we sell
our birthright.</p>
<p>Oh! Children of Israel, saw you not the long punishment you
were preparing for yourselves, when in your wilderness you set up
the image of the Calf, and fell before it,
crying&mdash;&ldquo;This shall be our God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You would have veal.&nbsp; Thought you never of the price man
pays for Veal?&nbsp; The servants of the Golden Calf!&nbsp; I see
them, stretched before my eyes, a weary, endless throng.&nbsp; I
see them toiling in the mines, the black sweat on their
faces.&nbsp; I see them in sunless cities, silent, and grimy, and
bent.&nbsp; I see them, ague-twisted, in the rain-soaked
fields.&nbsp; I see them, panting by the furnace doors.&nbsp; I
see them, in loin-cloth and necklace, the load upon their
head.&nbsp; I see them in blue coats and red coats, marching to
pour their blood as an offering on the altar of the Calf.&nbsp; I
see them in homespun and broadcloth, I see them in smock and
gaiters, I see them in cap and apron, the servants of the
Calf.&nbsp; They swarm on the land and they dot the sea.&nbsp;
They are chained to the anvil and counter; they are chained to
the bench and the desk.&nbsp; They make ready the soil, they till
the fields where the Golden Calf is born.&nbsp; They build the
ship, and they sail the ship that carries the Golden Calf.&nbsp;
They fashion the pots, they mould the pans, they carve the
tables, they turn the chairs, they dream of the sauces, they dig
for the salt, they weave the damask, they mould the dish to serve
the Golden Calf.</p>
<p>The work of the world is to this end, that we eat of the
Calf.&nbsp; War and Commerce, Science and Law! what are they but
the four pillars supporting the Golden Calf?&nbsp; He is our
God.&nbsp; It is on his back that we have journeyed from the
primeval forest, where our ancestors ate nuts and fruit.&nbsp; He
is our God.&nbsp; His temple is in every street.&nbsp; His
blue-robed priest stands ever at the door, calling to the people
to worship.&nbsp; Hark! his voice rises on the gas-tainted
air&mdash;&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your time!&nbsp; Now&rsquo;s your
time!&nbsp; Buy!&nbsp; Buy! ye people.&nbsp; Bring hither the
sweat of your brow, the sweat of your brain, the ache of your
heart, buy Veal with it.&nbsp; Bring me the best years of your
life.&nbsp; Bring me your thoughts, your hopes, your loves; ye
shall have Veal for them.&nbsp; Now&rsquo;s your time!&nbsp;
Now&rsquo;s your time!&nbsp; Buy!&nbsp; Buy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! Children of Israel, was Veal, even with all its trimmings,
quite worth the price?</p>
<p>And we! what wisdom have we learned, during the
centuries?&nbsp; I talked with a rich man only the other
evening.&nbsp; He calls himself a Financier, whatever that may
mean.&nbsp; He leaves his beautiful house, some twenty miles out
of London, at a quarter to eight, summer and winter, after a
hurried breakfast by himself, while his guests still sleep, and
he gets back just in time to dress for an elaborate dinner he
himself is too weary or too preoccupied to more than touch.&nbsp;
If ever he is persuaded to give himself a holiday it is for a
fortnight in Ostend, when it is most crowded and
uncomfortable.&nbsp; He takes his secretary with him, receives
and despatches a hundred telegrams a day, and has a private
telephone, through which he can speak direct to London, brought
up into his bedroom.</p>
<p>I suppose the telephone is really a useful invention.&nbsp;
Business men tell me they wonder how they contrived to conduct
their affairs without it.&nbsp; My own wonder always is, how any
human being with the ordinary passions of his race can conduct
his business, or even himself, creditably, within a hundred yards
of the invention.&nbsp; I can imagine Job, or Griselda, or
Socrates liking to have a telephone about them as exercise.&nbsp;
Socrates, in particular, would have made quite a reputation for
himself out of a three months&rsquo; subscription to a
telephone.&nbsp; Myself, I am, perhaps, too sensitive.&nbsp; I
once lived for a month in an office with a telephone, if one
could call it life.&nbsp; I was told that if I had stuck to the
thing for two or three months longer, I should have got used to
it.&nbsp; I know friends of mine, men once fearless and
high-spirited, who now stand in front of their own telephone for
a quarter of an hour at a time, and never so much as answer it
back.&nbsp; They tell me that at first they used to swear and
shout at it as I did; but now their spirit seems crushed.&nbsp;
That is what happens: you either break the telephone, or the
telephone breaks you.&nbsp; You want to see a man two streets
off.&nbsp; You might put on your hat, and be round at his office
in five minutes.&nbsp; You are on the point of starting when the
telephone catches your eye.&nbsp; You think you will ring him up
to make sure he is in.&nbsp; You commence by ringing up some
half-dozen times before anybody takes any notice of you
whatever.&nbsp; You are burning with indignation at this neglect,
and have left the instrument to sit down and pen a stinging
letter of complaint to the Company when the ring-back re-calls
you.&nbsp; You seize the ear trumpets, and shout&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that I can never get an answer when I
ring?&nbsp; Here have I been ringing for the last
half-hour.&nbsp; I have rung twenty times.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This is
a falsehood.&nbsp; You have rung only six times, and the
&ldquo;half-hour&rdquo; is an absurd exaggeration; but you feel
the mere truth would not be adequate to the occasion.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think it disgraceful,&rdquo; you continue, &ldquo;and I
shall complain to the Company.&nbsp; What is the use of my having
a telephone if I can&rsquo;t get any answer when I ring?&nbsp;
Here I pay a large sum for having this thing, and I can&rsquo;t
get any notice taken.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been ringing all the
morning.&nbsp; Why is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then you wait for the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what do you say?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t hear
what you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I&rsquo;ve been ringing here for over an hour,
and I can&rsquo;t get any reply,&rdquo; you call back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall complain to the Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want what?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stand so near the
tube.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t hear what you say.&nbsp; What
number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother the number; I say why is it I don&rsquo;t get an
answer when I ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight hundred and what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t argue any more, after that.&nbsp; The machine
would give way under the language you want to make use of.&nbsp;
Half of what you feel would probably cause an explosion at some
point where the wire was weak.&nbsp; Indeed, mere language of any
kind would fall short of the requirements of the case.&nbsp; A
hatchet and a gun are the only intermediaries through which you
could convey your meaning by this time.&nbsp; So you give up all
attempt to answer back, and meekly mention that you want to be
put in communication with four-five-seven-six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four-nine-seven-six?&rdquo; says the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; four-five-seven-six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say seven-six or six-seven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six-seven&mdash;no!&nbsp; I mean seven-six:
no&mdash;wait a minute.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what I do mean
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish you&rsquo;d find out,&rdquo; says the
young lady severely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are keeping me here all the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you look up the number in the book again, and at last she
tells you that you are in connection; and then, ramming the
trumpet tight against your ear, you stand waiting.</p>
<p>And if there is one thing more than another likely to make a
man feel ridiculous it is standing on tip-toe in a corner,
holding a machine to his head, and listening intently to
nothing.&nbsp; Your back aches and your head aches, your very
hair aches.&nbsp; You hear the door open behind you and somebody
enter the room.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t turn your head.&nbsp; You
swear at them, and hear the door close with a bang.&nbsp; It
immediately occurs to you that in all probability it was
Henrietta.&nbsp; She promised to call for you at half-past
twelve: you were to take her to lunch.&nbsp; It was twelve
o&rsquo;clock when you were fool enough to mix yourself up with
this infernal machine, and it probably is half-past twelve by
now.&nbsp; Your past life rises before you, accompanied by dim
memories of your grandmother.&nbsp; You are wondering how much
longer you can bear the strain of this attitude, and whether
after all you do really want to see the man in the next street
but two, when the girl in the exchange-room calls up to know if
you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; you retort bitterly; &ldquo;why, I
haven&rsquo;t begun yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be quick,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;because
you&rsquo;re wasting time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus admonished, you attack the thing again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Are</i> you there?&rdquo; you cry in tones that ought
to move the heart of a Charity Commissioner; and then, oh joy! oh
rapture! you hear a faint human voice replying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Are you four-five-seven-six?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you four-five-seven-six, Williamson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight-one-nine, Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>J</i>ones.&nbsp; Are you
four-five-seven-six?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Williamson in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I what&mdash;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jones!&nbsp; Is Mr. Williamson in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Williamson.&nbsp; Will-i-am-son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the son of what?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t hear
what you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then you gather yourself for one final effort, and succeed, by
superhuman patience, in getting the fool to understand that you
wish to know if Mr. Williamson is in, and he says, so it sounds
to you, &ldquo;Be in all the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you snatch up your hat and run round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve come to see Mr. Williamson,&rdquo; you
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sorry, sir,&rdquo; is the polite reply, &ldquo;but
he&rsquo;s out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out?&nbsp; Why, you just now told me through the
telephone that he&rsquo;d be in all the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I said, he &lsquo;<i>won&rsquo;t</i> be in all the
morning.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>You go back to the office, and sit down in front of that
telephone and look at it.&nbsp; There it hangs, calm and
imperturbable.&nbsp; Were it an ordinary instrument, that would
be its last hour.&nbsp; You would go straight down-stairs, get
the coal-hammer and the kitchen-poker, and divide it into
sufficient pieces to give a bit to every man in London.&nbsp; But
you feel nervous of these electrical affairs, and there is a
something about that telephone, with its black hole and curly
wires, that cows you.&nbsp; You have a notion that if you
don&rsquo;t handle it properly something may come and shock you,
and then there will be an inquest, and bother of that sort, so
you only curse it.</p>
<p>That is what happens when you want to use the telephone from
your end.&nbsp; But that is not the worst that the telephone can
do.&nbsp; A sensible man, after a little experience, can learn to
leave the thing alone.&nbsp; Your worst troubles are not of your
own making.&nbsp; You are working against time; you have given
instructions not to be disturbed.&nbsp; Perhaps it is after
lunch, and you are thinking with your eyes closed, so that your
thoughts shall not be distracted by the objects about the
room.&nbsp; In either case you are anxious not to leave your
chair, when off goes that telephone bell and you spring from your
chair, uncertain, for the moment, whether you have been shot, or
blown up with dynamite.&nbsp; It occurs to you in your weakness
that if you persist in taking no notice, they will get tired, and
leave you alone.&nbsp; But that is not their method.&nbsp; The
bell rings violently at ten-second intervals.&nbsp; You have
nothing to wrap your head up in.&nbsp; You think it will be
better to get this business over and done with.&nbsp; You go to
your fate and call back savagely&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer, only a confused murmur, prominent out of which come
the voices of two men swearing at one another.&nbsp; The language
they are making use of is disgraceful.&nbsp; The telephone seems
peculiarly adapted for the conveyance of blasphemy.&nbsp;
Ordinary language sounds indistinct through it; but every word
those two men are saying can be heard by all the telephone
subscribers in London.</p>
<p>It is useless attempting to listen till they have done.&nbsp;
When they are exhausted, you apply to the tube again.&nbsp; No
answer is obtainable.&nbsp; You get mad, and become sarcastic;
only being sarcastic when you are not sure that anybody is at the
other end to hear you is unsatisfying.</p>
<p>At last, after a quarter of an hour or so of saying,
&ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m
here,&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; the young lady at the
Exchange asks what you want.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything,&rdquo; you reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you keep talking?&rdquo; she retorts;
&ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t play with the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This renders you speechless with indignation for a while, upon
recovering from which you explain that somebody rang you up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Who</i> rang you up?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you did,&rdquo; she observes.</p>
<p>Generally disgusted, you slam the trumpet up and return to
your chair.&nbsp; The instant you are seated the bell clangs
again; and you fly up and demand to know what the thunder they
want, and who the thunder they are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak so loud, we can&rsquo;t hear
you.&nbsp; What do you want?&rdquo; is the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything.&nbsp; What do you
want?&nbsp; Why do you ring me up, and then not answer me?&nbsp;
Do leave me alone, if you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get Hong Kongs at
seventy-four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care if you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like Zulus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; you reply; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like Zulus&mdash;Zulus at seventy-three and a
half?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em at six a penny.&nbsp;
What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hong Kongs&mdash;we can&rsquo;t get them at
seventy-four.&nbsp; Oh, half-a-minute&rdquo; (the half-a-minute
passes).&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are talking to the wrong man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get you Hong Kongs at seventy-four and
seven-eights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother Hong Kongs, and you too.&nbsp; I tell you, you
are talking to the wrong man.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve told you
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that I am the wrong man&mdash;I mean that you are
talking to the wrong man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight-one-nine, Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t you one-nine-eight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can a man after that sit down and write pleasantly of the
European crisis?&nbsp; And, if it were needed, herein lies
another indictment against the telephone.&nbsp; I was engaged in
an argument, which, if not in itself serious, was at least
concerned with a serious enough subject, the unsatisfactory
nature of human riches; and from that highly moral discussion
have I been lured, by the accidental sight of the word
&ldquo;telephone,&rdquo; into the writing of matter which can
have the effect only of exciting to frenzy all critics of the New
Humour into whose hands, for their sins, this book may
come.&nbsp; Let me forget my transgression and return to my
sermon, or rather to the sermon of my millionaire
acquaintance.</p>
<p>It was one day after dinner, we sat together in his
magnificently furnished dining-room.&nbsp; We had lighted our
cigars at the silver lamp.&nbsp; The butler had withdrawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These cigars we are smoking,&rdquo; my friend suddenly
remarked, <i>&agrave; propos</i> apparently of nothing,
&ldquo;they cost me five shillings apiece, taking them by the
thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can quite believe it,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;they
are worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to you,&rdquo; he replied, almost savagely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you usually pay for your cigars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had known each other years ago.&nbsp; When I first met him
his offices consisted of a back room up three flights of stairs
in a dingy by-street off the Strand, which has since
disappeared.&nbsp; We occasionally dined together, in those days,
at a restaurant in Great Portland Street, for one and nine.&nbsp;
Our acquaintanceship was of sufficient standing to allow of such
a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Threepence,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They work
out at about twopence three-farthings by the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; he growled; &ldquo;and your
twopenny-three-farthing weed gives you precisely the same amount
of satisfaction that this five shilling cigar affords me.&nbsp;
That means four and ninepence farthing wasted every time I
smoke.&nbsp; I pay my cook two hundred a year.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t enjoy my dinner as much as when it cost me four
shillings, including a quarter flask of Chianti.&nbsp; What is
the difference, personally, to me whether I drive to my office in
a carriage and pair, or in an omnibus?&nbsp; I often do ride in a
bus: it saves trouble.&nbsp; It is absurd wasting time looking
for one&rsquo;s coachman, when the conductor of an omnibus that
passes one&rsquo;s door is hailing one a few yards off.&nbsp;
Before I could afford even buses&mdash;when I used to walk every
morning to the office from Hammersmith&mdash;I was
healthier.&nbsp; It irritates me to think how hard I work for no
earthly benefit to myself.&nbsp; My money pleases a lot of people
I don&rsquo;t care two straws about, and who are only my friends
in the hope of making something out of me.&nbsp; If I could eat a
hundred-guinea dinner myself every night, and enjoy it four
hundred times as much as I used to enjoy a five-shilling dinner,
there would be some sense in it.&nbsp; Why do I do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never heard him talk like this before.&nbsp; In his
excitement he rose from the table, and commenced pacing the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I invest my money in the two and a half
per cents?&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the very worst I
should be safe for five thousand a year.&nbsp; What, in the name
of common sense, does a man want with more?&nbsp; I am always
saying to myself, I&rsquo;ll do it; why don&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; I echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want you to tell me,&rdquo; he
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;You set up for understanding human nature,
it&rsquo;s a mystery to me.&nbsp; In my place, you would do as I
do; you know that.&nbsp; If somebody left you a hundred thousand
pounds to-morrow, you would start a newspaper, or build a
theatre&mdash;some damn-fool trick for getting rid of the money
and giving yourself seventeen hours&rsquo; anxiety a day; you
know you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hung my head in shame.&nbsp; I felt the justice of the
accusation.&nbsp; It has always been my dream to run a newspaper
and own a theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we worked only for what we could spend,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;the City might put up its shutters to-morrow
morning.&nbsp; What I want to get at the bottom of is this
instinct that drives us to work apparently for work&rsquo;s own
sake.&nbsp; What is this strange thing that gets upon our back
and spurs us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant entered at that moment with a cablegram from the
manager of one of his Austrian mines, and he had to leave me for
his study.&nbsp; But, walking home, I fell to pondering on his
words.&nbsp; <i>Why</i> this endless work?&nbsp; Why each morning
do we get up and wash and dress ourselves, to undress ourselves
at night and go to bed again?&nbsp; Why do we work merely to earn
money to buy food; and eat food so as to gain strength that we
may work?&nbsp; Why do we live, merely in the end to say good-bye
to one another?&nbsp; Why do we labour to bring children into the
world that they may die and be buried?</p>
<p>Of what use our mad striving, our passionate desire?&nbsp;
Will it matter to the ages whether, once upon a time, the Union
Jack or the Tricolour floated over the battlements of
Badajoz?&nbsp; Yet we poured our blood into its ditches to decide
the question.&nbsp; Will it matter, in the days when the glacial
period shall have come again, to clothe the earth with silence,
whose foot first trod the Pole?&nbsp; Yet, generation after
generation, we mile its roadway with our whitening bones.&nbsp;
So very soon the worms come to us; does it matter whether we
love, or hate?&nbsp; Yet the hot blood rushes through our veins,
we wear out heart and brain for shadowy hopes that ever fade as
we press forward.</p>
<p>The flower struggles up from seed-pod, draws the sweet sap
from the ground, folds its petals each night, and sleeps.&nbsp;
Then love comes to it in a strange form, and it longs to mingle
its pollen with the pollen of some other flower.&nbsp; So it puts
forth its gay blossoms, and the wandering insect bears the
message from seed-pod to seed-pod.&nbsp; And the seasons pass,
bringing with them the sunshine and the rain, till the flower
withers, never having known the real purpose for which it lived,
thinking the garden was made for it, not it for the garden.&nbsp;
The coral insect dreams in its small soul, which is possibly its
small stomach, of home and food.&nbsp; So it works and strives
deep down in the dark waters, never knowing of the continents it
is fashioning.</p>
<p>But the question still remains: for what purpose is it
all?&nbsp; Science explains it to us.&nbsp; By ages of strife and
effort we improve the race; from ether, through the monkey, man
is born.&nbsp; So, through the labour of the coming ages, he will
free himself still further from the brute.&nbsp; Through sorrow
and through struggle, by the sweat of brain and brow, he will
lift himself towards the angels.&nbsp; He will come into his
kingdom.</p>
<p>But why the building?&nbsp; Why the passing of the countless
ages?&nbsp; Why should he not have been born the god he is to be,
imbued at birth with all the capabilities his ancestors have died
acquiring?&nbsp; Why the Pict and Hun that <i>I</i> may be?&nbsp;
Why <i>I</i>, that a descendant of my own, to whom I shall seem a
savage, shall come after me?&nbsp; Why, if the universe be
ordered by a Creator to whom all things are possible, the
protoplasmic cell?&nbsp; Why not the man that is to be?&nbsp;
Shall all the generations be so much human waste that he may
live?&nbsp; Am I but another layer of the soil preparing for
him?</p>
<p>Or, if our future be in other spheres, then why the need of
this planet?&nbsp; Are we labouring at some Work too vast for us
to perceive?&nbsp; Are our passions and desires mere whips and
traces by the help of which we are driven?&nbsp; Any theory seems
more hopeful than the thought that all our eager, fretful lives
are but the turning of a useless prison crank.&nbsp; Looking back
the little distance that our dim eyes can penetrate the past,
what do we find?&nbsp; Civilizations, built up with infinite
care, swept aside and lost.&nbsp; Beliefs for which men lived and
died, proved to be mockeries.&nbsp; Greek Art crushed to the dust
by Gothic bludgeons.&nbsp; Dreams of fraternity, drowned in blood
by a Napoleon.&nbsp; What is left to us, but the hope that the
work itself, not the result, is the real monument?&nbsp; Maybe,
we are as children, asking, &ldquo;Of what use are these
lessons?&nbsp; What good will they ever be to us?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But there comes a day when the lad understands why he learnt
grammar and geography, when even dates have a meaning for
him.&nbsp; But this is not until he has left school, and gone out
into the wider world.&nbsp; So, perhaps, when we are a little
more grown up, we too may begin to understand the reason for our
living.</p>

THE CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF WOMEN</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">talked</span> to a woman once on the
subject of honeymoons.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Would you recommend a
long honeymoon, or a Saturday to Monday somewhere?&rdquo;&nbsp; A
silence fell upon her.&nbsp; I gathered she was looking back
rather than forward to her answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would advise a long honeymoon,&rdquo; she replied at
length, &ldquo;the old-fashioned month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I persisted, &ldquo;I thought the tendency
of the age was to cut these things shorter and
shorter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the tendency of the age,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;to seek escape from many things it would be wiser to
face.&nbsp; I think myself that, for good or evil, the sooner it
is over&mdash;the sooner both the man and the woman
know&mdash;the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner what is over?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>If she had a fault, this woman, about which I am not sure, it
was an inclination towards enigma.</p>
<p>She crossed to the window and stood there, looking out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there not a custom,&rdquo; she said, still gazing
down into the wet, glistening street, &ldquo;among one of the
ancient peoples, I forget which, ordaining that when a man and
woman, loving one another, or thinking that they loved, had been
joined together, they should go down upon their wedding night to
the temple?&nbsp; And into the dark recesses of the temple,
through many winding passages, the priest led them until they
came to the great chamber where dwelt the voice of their
god.&nbsp; There the priest left them, clanging-to the massive
door behind him, and there, alone in silence, they made their
sacrifice; and in the night the Voice spoke to them, showing them
their future life&mdash;whether they had chosen well; whether
their love would live or die.&nbsp; And in the morning the priest
returned and led them back into the day; and they dwelt among
their fellows.&nbsp; But no one was permitted to question them,
nor they to answer should any do so.&nbsp; Well, do you know, our
nineteenth-century honeymoon at Brighton, Switzerland, or
Ramsgate, as the choice or necessity may be, always seems to me
merely another form of that night spent alone in the temple
before the altar of that forgotten god.&nbsp; Our young men and
women marry, and we kiss them and congratulate them; and,
standing on the doorstep, throw rice and old slippers, and shout
good wishes after them; and he waves his gloved hand to us, and
she flutters her little handkerchief from the carriage window;
and we watch their smiling faces and hear their laughter until
the corner hides them from our view.&nbsp; Then we go about our
own business, and a short time passes by; and one day we meet
them again, and their faces have grown older and graver; and I
always wonder what the Voice has told them during that little
while that they have been absent from our sight.&nbsp; But of
course it would not do to ask them.&nbsp; Nor would they answer
truly if we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend laughed, and, leaving the window, took her place
beside the tea-things, and other callers dropping in, we fell to
talk of pictures, plays, and people.</p>
<p>But I felt it would be unwise to act on her sole advice, much
as I have always valued her opinion.</p>
<p>A woman takes life too seriously.&nbsp; It is a serious affair
to most of us, the Lord knows.&nbsp; That is why it is well not
to take it more seriously than need be.</p>
<p>Little Jack and little Jill fall down the hill, hurting their
little knees, and their little noses, spilling the hard-earned
water.&nbsp; We are very philosophical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo; we tell them, &ldquo;that
is babyish.&nbsp; Little boys and little girls must learn to bear
pain.&nbsp; Up you get, fill the pail again, and try once
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Jack and little Jill rub their dirty knuckles into
their little eyes, looking ruefully at their bloody little knees,
and trot back with the pail.&nbsp; We laugh at them, but not
ill-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little souls,&rdquo; we say; &ldquo;how they did
hullabaloo.&nbsp; One might have thought they were
half-killed.&nbsp; And it was only a broken crown, after
all.&nbsp; What a fuss children make!&rdquo;&nbsp; We bear with
much stoicism the fall of little Jack and little Jill.</p>
<p>But when <i>we</i>&mdash;grown-up Jack with moustache turning
grey; grown-up Jill with the first faint &ldquo;crow&rsquo;s
feet&rdquo; showing&mdash;when <i>we</i> tumble down the hill,
and <i>our</i> pail is spilt.&nbsp; Ye Heavens! what a tragedy
has happened.&nbsp; Put out the stars, turn off the sun, suspend
the laws of nature.&nbsp; Mr. Jack and Mrs. Jill, coming down the
hill&mdash;what they were doing on the hill we will not
inquire&mdash;have slipped over a stone, placed there surely by
the evil powers of the universe.&nbsp; Mr. Jack and Mrs. Jill
have bumped their silly heads.&nbsp; Mr. Jack and Mrs. Jill have
hurt their little hearts, and stand marvelling that the world can
go about its business in the face of such disaster.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take the matter quite so seriously, Jack and
Jill.&nbsp; You have spilled your happiness, you must toil up the
hill again and refill the pail.&nbsp; Carry it more carefully
next time.&nbsp; What were you doing?&nbsp; Playing some
fool&rsquo;s trick, I&rsquo;ll be bound.</p>
<p>A laugh and a sigh, a kiss and good-bye, is our life.&nbsp; Is
it worth so much fretting?&nbsp; It is a merry life on the
whole.&nbsp; Courage, comrade.&nbsp; A campaign cannot be all
drum and fife and stirrup-cup.&nbsp; The marching and the
fighting must come into it somewhere.&nbsp; There are pleasant
bivouacs among the vineyards, merry nights around the camp
fires.&nbsp; White hands wave a welcome to us; bright eyes dim at
our going.&nbsp; Would you run from the battle-music?&nbsp; What
have you to complain of?&nbsp; Forward: the medal to some, the
surgeon&rsquo;s knife to others; to all of us, sooner or later,
six feet of mother earth.&nbsp; What are you afraid of?&nbsp;
Courage, comrade.</p>
<p>There is a mean between basking through life with the smiling
contentment of the alligator, and shivering through it with the
aggressive sensibility of the Lama determined to die at every
cross word.&nbsp; To bear it as a man we must also feel it as a
man.&nbsp; My philosophic friend, seek not to comfort a brother
standing by the coffin of his child with the cheery suggestion
that it will be all the same a hundred years hence, because, for
one thing, the observation is not true: the man is changed for
all eternity&mdash;possibly for the better, but don&rsquo;t add
that.&nbsp; A soldier with a bullet in his neck is never quite
the man he was.&nbsp; But he can laugh and he can talk, drink his
wine and ride his horse.&nbsp; Now and again, towards evening,
when the weather is trying, the sickness will come upon
him.&nbsp; You will find him on a couch in a dark corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! old fellow, anything up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a twinge, the old wound, you know.&nbsp; I
will be better in a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shut the door of the dark room quietly.&nbsp; I should not
stay even to sympathize with him if I were you.&nbsp; The men
will be coming to screw the coffin down soon.&nbsp; I think he
would like to be alone with it till then.&nbsp; Let us leave
him.&nbsp; He will come back to the club later on in the
season.&nbsp; For a while we may have to give him another ten
points or so, but he will soon get back his old form.&nbsp; Now
and again, when he meets the other fellows&rsquo; boys shouting
on the towing-path; when Brown rushes up the drive, paper in
hand, to tell him how that young scapegrace Jim has won his
Cross; when he is congratulating Jones&rsquo;s eldest on having
passed with honours, the old wound may give him a nasty
twinge.&nbsp; But the pain will pass away.&nbsp; He will laugh at
our stories and tell us his own; eat his dinner, play his
rubber.&nbsp; It is only a wound.</p>
<p>Tommy can never be ours, Jenny does not love us.&nbsp; We
cannot afford claret, so we will have to drink beer.&nbsp; Well,
what would you have us do?&nbsp; Yes, let us curse Fate by all
means&mdash;some one to curse is always useful.&nbsp; Let us cry
and wring our hands&mdash;for how long?&nbsp; The dinner-bell
will ring soon, and the Smiths are coming.&nbsp; We shall have to
talk about the opera and the picture-galleries.&nbsp; Quick,
where is the eau-de-Cologne? where are the curling-tongs?&nbsp;
Or would you we committed suicide?&nbsp; Is it worth while?&nbsp;
Only a few more years&mdash;perhaps to-morrow, by aid of a piece
of orange peel or a broken chimney-pot&mdash;and Fate will save
us all that trouble.</p>
<p>Or shall we, as sulky children, mope day after day?&nbsp; We
are a broken-hearted little Jack&mdash;little Jill.&nbsp; We will
never smile again; we will pine away and die, and be buried in
the spring.&nbsp; The world is sad, and life so cruel, and heaven
so cold.&nbsp; Oh dear! oh dear! we have hurt ourselves.</p>
<p>We whimper and whine at every pain.&nbsp; In old strong days
men faced real dangers, real troubles every hour; they had no
time to cry.&nbsp; Death and disaster stood ever at the
door.&nbsp; Men were contemptuous of them.&nbsp; Now in each snug
protected villa we set to work to make wounds out of
scratches.&nbsp; Every head-ache becomes an agony, every
heart-ache a tragedy.&nbsp; It took a murdered father, a drowned
sweetheart, a dishonoured mother, a ghost, and a slaughtered
Prime Minister to produce the emotions in Hamlet that a modern
minor poet obtains from a chorus girl&rsquo;s frown, or a
temporary slump on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp; Like Mrs. Gummidge,
we feel it more.&nbsp; The lighter and easier life gets the more
seriously we go out to meet it.&nbsp; The boatmen of Ulysses
faced the thunder and the sunshine alike with frolic
welcome.&nbsp; We modern sailors have grown more sensitive.&nbsp;
The sunshine scorches us, the rain chills us.&nbsp; We meet both
with loud self-pity.</p>
<p>Thinking these thoughts, I sought a second friend&mdash;a man
whose breezy common-sense has often helped me, and him likewise I
questioned on this subject of honeymoons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;take my advice,
if ever you get married, arrange it so that the honeymoon shall
only last a week, and let it be a bustling week into the
bargain.&nbsp; Take a Cook&rsquo;s circular tour.&nbsp; Get
married on the Saturday morning, cut the breakfast and all that
foolishness, and catch the eleven-ten from Charing Cross to
Paris.&nbsp; Take her up the Eiffel Tower on Sunday.&nbsp; Lunch
at Fontainebleau.&nbsp; Dine at the Maison Doree, and show her
the Moulin Rouge in the evening.&nbsp; Take the night train for
Lucerne.&nbsp; Devote Monday and Tuesday to doing Switzerland,
and get into Rome by Thursday morning, taking the Italian lakes
<i>en route</i>.&nbsp; On Friday cross to Marseilles, and from
there push along to Monte Carlo.&nbsp; Let her have a flutter at
the tables.&nbsp; Start early Saturday morning for Spain, cross
the Pyrenees on mules, and rest at Bordeaux on Sunday.&nbsp; Get
back to Paris on Monday (Monday is always a good day for the
opera), and on Tuesday evening you will be at home, and glad to
get there.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t give her time to criticize you until
she has got used to you.&nbsp; No man will bear unprotected
exposure to a young girl&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; The honeymoon is the
matrimonial microscope.&nbsp; Wobble it.&nbsp; Confuse it with
many objects.&nbsp; Cloud it with other interests.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t sit still to be examined.&nbsp; Besides, remember
that a man always appears at his best when active, and a woman at
her worst.&nbsp; Bustle her, my dear boy, bustle her: I
don&rsquo;t care who she may be.&nbsp; Give her plenty of luggage
to look after; make her catch trains.&nbsp; Let her see the
average husband sprawling comfortably over the railway cushions,
while his wife has to sit bolt upright in the corner left to
her.&nbsp; Let her hear how other men swear.&nbsp; Let her smell
other men&rsquo;s tobacco.&nbsp; Hurry up, and get her accustomed
quickly to the sight of mankind.&nbsp; Then she will be less
surprised and shocked as she grows to know you.&nbsp; One of the
best fellows I ever knew spoilt his married life beyond repair by
a long quiet honeymoon.&nbsp; They went off for a month to a
lonely cottage in some heaven-forsaken spot, where never a soul
came near them, and never a thing happened but morning,
afternoon, and night.&nbsp; There for thirty days she overhauled
him.&nbsp; When he yawned&mdash;and he yawned pretty often, I
guess, during that month&mdash;she thought of the size of his
mouth, and when he put his heels upon the fender she sat and
brooded upon the shape of his feet.&nbsp; At meal-time, not
feeling hungry herself, having nothing to do to make her hungry,
she would occupy herself with watching him eat; and at night, not
feeling sleepy for the same reason, she would lie awake and
listen to his snoring.&nbsp; After the first day or two he grew
tired of talking nonsense, and she of listening to it (it sounded
nonsense now they could speak it aloud; they had fancied it
poetry when they had had to whisper it); and having no other
subject, as yet, of common interest, they would sit and stare in
front of them in silence.&nbsp; One day some trifle irritated him
and he swore.&nbsp; On a busy railway platform, or in a crowded
hotel, she would have said, &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; and they would both
have laughed.&nbsp; From that echoing desert the silly words rose
up in widening circles towards the sky, and that night she cried
herself to sleep.&nbsp; Bustle them, my dear boy, bustle
them.&nbsp; We all like each other better the less we think about
one another, and the honeymoon is an exceptionally critical
time.&nbsp; Bustle her, my dear boy, bustle her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My very worst honeymoon experience took place in the South of
England in eighteen hundred and&mdash;well, never mind the exact
date, let us say a few years ago.&nbsp; I was a shy young man at
that time.&nbsp; Many complain of my reserve to this day, but
then some girls expect too much from a man.&nbsp; We all have our
shortcomings.&nbsp; Even then, however, I was not so shy as
she.&nbsp; We had to travel from Lyndhurst in the New Forest to
Ventnor, an awkward bit of cross-country work in those days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so fortunate you are going too,&rdquo; said
her aunt to me on the Tuesday; &ldquo;Minnie is always nervous
travelling alone.&nbsp; You will be able to look after her, and I
shan&rsquo;t be anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said it would be a pleasure, and at the time I honestly
thought it.&nbsp; On the Wednesday I went down to the coach
office, and booked two places for Lymington, from where we took
the steamer.&nbsp; I had not a suspicion of trouble.</p>
<p>The booking-clerk was an elderly man.&nbsp; He said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the box seat, and the end place on the
back bench.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t I have two together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a kindly-looking old fellow.&nbsp; He winked at
me.&nbsp; I wondered all the way home why he had winked at
me.&nbsp; He said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage it somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid his hand on my shoulder.&nbsp; He struck me as
familiar, but well-intentioned.&nbsp; He said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have all of us been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought he was alluding to the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; I
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the best time of the year for it, so
I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was early summer time.</p>
<p>He said&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right in summer, and
it&rsquo;s good enough in winter&mdash;<i>while it
lasts</i>.&nbsp; You make the most of it, young &rsquo;un;&rdquo;
and he slapped me on the back and laughed.</p>
<p>He would have irritated me in another minute.&nbsp; I paid for
the seats and left him.</p>
<p>At half-past eight the next morning Minnie and I started for
the coach-office.&nbsp; I call her Minnie, not with any wish to
be impertinent, but because I have forgotten her surname.&nbsp;
It must be ten years since I last saw her.&nbsp; She was a pretty
girl, too, with those brown eyes that always cloud before they
laugh.&nbsp; Her aunt did not drive down with us as she had
intended, in consequence of a headache.&nbsp; She was good enough
to say she felt every confidence in me.</p>
<p>The old booking-clerk caught sight of us when we were about a
quarter of a mile away, and drew to us the attention of the
coachman, who communicated the fact of our approach to the
gathered passengers.&nbsp; Everybody left off talking, and waited
for us.&nbsp; The boots seized his horn, and blew&mdash;one could
hardly call it a blast; it would be difficult to say what he
blew.&nbsp; He put his heart into it, but not sufficient
wind.&nbsp; I think his intention was to welcome us, but it
suggested rather a feeble curse.&nbsp; We learnt subsequently
that he was a beginner on the instrument.</p>
<p>In some mysterious way the whole affair appeared to be our
party.&nbsp; The booking-clerk bustled up and helped Minnie from
the cart.&nbsp; I feared, for a moment, he was going to kiss
her.&nbsp; The coachman grinned when I said good-morning to
him.&nbsp; The passengers grinned, the boots grinned.&nbsp; Two
chamber-maids and a waiter came out from the hotel, and they
grinned.&nbsp; I drew Minnie aside, and whispered to her.&nbsp; I
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something funny about us.&nbsp; All these
people are grinning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked round me, and I walked round her, but we could
neither of us discover anything amusing about the other.&nbsp;
The booking-clerk said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got you young
people two places just behind the box-seat.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
have to put five of you on that seat.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t mind
sitting a bit close, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The booking-clerk winked at the coachman, the coachman winked
at the passengers, the passengers winked at one
another&mdash;those of them who could wink&mdash;and everybody
laughed.&nbsp; The two chamber-maids became hysterical, and had
to cling to each other for support.&nbsp; With the exception of
Minnie and myself, it seemed to be the merriest coach party ever
assembled at Lyndhurst.</p>
<p>We had taken our places, and I was still busy trying to fathom
the joke, when a stout lady appeared on the scene, and demanded
to know her place.</p>
<p>The clerk explained to her that it was in the middle behind
the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had to put five of you on that seat,&rdquo;
added the clerk.</p>
<p>The stout lady looked at the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five of us can&rsquo;t squeeze into that,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Five of her certainly could not.&nbsp; Four ordinary sized
people with her would find it tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;you can
have the end place on the back seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; said the stout lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I booked my seat on Monday, and you told me any of the
front places were vacant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> take the back place,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stop where you are, young &rsquo;un,&rdquo; said
the clerk, firmly, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t be a fool.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll fix <i>her</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I objected to his language, but his tone was kindness
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let <i>me</i> have the back seat,&rdquo; said
Minnie, rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d so like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the coachman put both his hands on her
shoulders.&nbsp; He was a heavy man, and she sat down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, mum,&rdquo; said the clerk, addressing the
stout lady, &ldquo;are you going up there in the middle, or are
you coming up here at the back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not let one of them take the back seat?&rdquo;
demanded the stout lady, pointing her reticule at Minnie and
myself; &ldquo;they say they&rsquo;d like it.&nbsp; Let them have
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coachman rose, and addressed his remarks generally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put her up at the back, or leave her behind,&rdquo; he
directed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man and wife have never been separated on
this coach since I started running it fifteen year ago, and they
ain&rsquo;t going to be now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general cheer greeted this sentiment.&nbsp; The stout lady,
now regarded as a would-be blighter of love&rsquo;s young dream,
was hustled into the back seat, the whip cracked, and away we
rolled.</p>
<p>So here was the explanation.&nbsp; We were in a honeymoon
district, in June&mdash;the most popular month in the whole year
for marriage.&nbsp; Every two out of three couples found
wandering about the New Forest in June are honeymoon couples; the
third are going to be.&nbsp; When they travel anywhere it is to
the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; We both had on new clothes.&nbsp; Our
bags happened to be new.&nbsp; By some evil chance our very
umbrellas were new.&nbsp; Our united ages were
thirty-seven.&nbsp; The wonder would have been had we <i>not</i>
been mistaken for a young married couple.</p>
<p>A day of greater misery I have rarely passed.&nbsp; To Minnie,
so her aunt informed me afterwards, the journey was the most
terrible experience of her life, but then her experience, up to
that time, had been limited.&nbsp; She was engaged, and devotedly
attached, to a young clergyman; I was madly in love with a
somewhat plump girl named Cecilia who lived with her mother at
Hampstead.&nbsp; I am positive as to her living at
Hampstead.&nbsp; I remember so distinctly my weekly walk down the
hill from Church Row to the Swiss Cottage station.&nbsp; When
walking down a steep hill all the weight of the body is forced
into the toe of the boot, and when the boot is two sizes too
small for you, and you have been living in it since the early
afternoon, you remember a thing like that.&nbsp; But all my
recollections of Cecilia are painful, and it is needless to
pursue them.</p>
<p>Our coach-load was a homely party, and some of the jokes were
broad&mdash;harmless enough in themselves, had Minnie and I
really been the married couple we were supposed to be, but even
in that case unnecessary.&nbsp; I can only hope that Minnie did
not understand them.&nbsp; Anyhow, she looked as if she
didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I forget where we stopped for lunch, but I remember that lamb
and mint sauce was on the table, and that the circumstance
afforded the greatest delight to all the party, with the
exception of the stout lady, who was still indignant, Minnie and
myself.&nbsp; About my behaviour as a bridegroom opinion appeared
to be divided.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bit standoffish with
her,&rdquo; I overheard one lady remark to her husband; &ldquo;I
like to see &rsquo;em a bit kittenish myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
young waitress, on the other hand, I am happy to say, showed more
sense of natural reserve.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I respect him for
it,&rdquo; she was saying to the barmaid, as we passed through
the hall; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just hate to be fuzzled over with
everybody looking on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody took the trouble to
drop their voices for our benefit.&nbsp; We might have been a
pair of prize love birds on exhibition, the way we were openly
discussed.&nbsp; By the majority we were clearly regarded as a
sulky young couple who would not go through their tricks.</p>
<p>I have often wondered since how a real married couple would
have faced the situation.&nbsp; Possibly, had we consented to
give a short display of marital affection, &ldquo;by
desire,&rdquo; we might have been left in peace for the remainder
of the journey.</p>
<p>Our reputation preceded us on to the steamboat.&nbsp; Minnie
begged and prayed me to let it be known we were not
married.&nbsp; How I was to let it be known, except by requesting
the captain to summon the whole ship&rsquo;s company on deck, and
then making them a short speech, I could not think.&nbsp; Minnie
said she could not bear it any longer, and retired to the
ladies&rsquo; cabin.&nbsp; She went off crying.&nbsp; Her trouble
was attributed by crew and passengers to my coldness.&nbsp; One
fool planted himself opposite me with his legs apart, and shook
his head at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down and comfort her,&rdquo; he began.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take an old man&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp; Put your arms around
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He was one of those sentimental idiots.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell her that you love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him to go and hang himself, with so much vigour that he
all but fell overboard.&nbsp; He was saved by a poultry crate: I
had no luck that day.</p>
<p>At Ryde the guard, by superhuman effort, contrived to keep us
a carriage to ourselves.&nbsp; I gave him a shilling, because I
did not know what else to do.&nbsp; I would have made it
half-a-sovereign if he had put eight other passengers in with
us.&nbsp; At every station people came to the window to look in
at us.</p>
<p>I handed Minnie over to her father on Ventnor platform; and I
took the first train the next morning, to London.&nbsp; I felt I
did not want to see her again for a little while; and I felt
convinced she could do without a visit from me.&nbsp; Our next
meeting took place the week before her marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to spend your honeymoon?&rdquo; I
asked her; &ldquo;in the New Forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;nor in the Isle of
Wight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To enjoy the humour of an incident one must be at some
distance from it either in time or relationship.&nbsp; I remember
watching an amusing scene in Whitefield Street, just off
Tottenham Court Road, one winter&rsquo;s Saturday night.&nbsp; A
woman&mdash;a rather respectable looking woman, had her hat only
been on straight&mdash;had just been shot out of a
public-house.&nbsp; She was very dignified, and very drunk.&nbsp;
A policeman requested her to move on.&nbsp; She called him
&ldquo;Fellow,&rdquo; and demanded to know of him if he
considered that was the proper tone in which to address a
lady.&nbsp; She threatened to report him to her cousin, the Lord
Chancellor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; this way to the Lord Chancellor,&rdquo; retorted
the policeman.&nbsp; &ldquo;You come along with me;&rdquo; and he
caught hold of her by the arm.</p>
<p>She gave a lurch, and nearly fell.&nbsp; To save her the man
put his arm round her waist.&nbsp; She clasped him round the
neck, and together they spun round two or three times; while at
the very moment a piano-organ at the opposite corner struck up a
waltz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose your partners, gentlemen, for the next
dance,&rdquo; shouted a wag, and the crowd roared.</p>
<p>I was laughing myself, for the situation was undeniably
comical, the constable&rsquo;s expression of disgust being quite
Hogarthian, when the sight of a child&rsquo;s face beneath the
gas-lamp stayed me.&nbsp; Her look was so full of terror that I
tried to comfort her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a drunken woman,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s not going to hurt her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s

<p>Our joke is generally another&rsquo;s pain.&nbsp; The man who
sits down on the tin-tack rarely joins in the laugh.</p>

THE MINDING OF OTHER PEOPLE&rsquo;S BUSINESS</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">walked</span> one bright September
morning in the Strand.&nbsp; I love London best in the
autumn.&nbsp; Then only can one see the gleam of its white
pavements, the bold, unbroken outline of its streets.&nbsp; I
love the cool vistas one comes across of mornings in the parks,
the soft twilights that linger in the empty bye-streets.&nbsp; In
June the restaurant manager is off-hand with me; I feel I am but
in his way.&nbsp; In August he spreads for me the table by the
window, pours out for me my wine with his own fat hands.&nbsp; I
cannot doubt his regard for me: my foolish jealousies are
stilled.&nbsp; Do I care for a drive after dinner through the
caressing night air, I can climb the omnibus stair without a
preliminary fight upon the curb, can sit with easy conscience and
unsquashed body, not feeling I have deprived some hot, tired
woman of a seat.&nbsp; Do I desire the play, no harsh, forbidding
&ldquo;House full&rdquo; board repels me from the door.&nbsp;
During her season, London, a harassed hostess, has no time for
us, her intimates.&nbsp; Her rooms are overcrowded, her servants
overworked, her dinners hurriedly cooked, her tone
insincere.&nbsp; In the spring, to be truthful, the great lady
condescends to be somewhat vulgar&mdash;noisy and
ostentatious.&nbsp; Not till the guests are departed is she
herself again, the London that we, her children, love.</p>
<p>Have you, gentle Reader, ever seen London&mdash;not the London
of the waking day, coated with crawling life, as a blossom with
blight, but the London of the morning, freed from her rags, the
patient city, clad in mists?&nbsp; Get you up with the dawn one
Sunday in summer time.&nbsp; Wake none else, but creep down
stealthily into the kitchen, and make your own tea and toast.</p>
<p>Be careful you stumble not over the cat.&nbsp; She will worm
herself insidiously between your legs.&nbsp; It is her way; she
means it in friendship.&nbsp; Neither bark your shins against the
coal-box.&nbsp; Why the kitchen coal-box has its fixed place in
the direct line between the kitchen door and the gas-bracket I
cannot say.&nbsp; I merely know it as an universal law; and I
would that you escaped that coal-box, lest the frame of mind I
desire for you on this Sabbath morning be dissipated.</p>
<p>A spoon to stir your tea, I fear you must dispense with.&nbsp;
Knives and forks you will discover in plenty; blacking brushes
you will put your hand upon in every drawer; of emery paper, did
one require it, there are reams; but it is a point with every
housekeeper that the spoons be hidden in a different place each
night.&nbsp; If anybody excepting herself can find them in the
morning, it is a slur upon her.&nbsp; No matter, a stick of
firewood, sharpened at one end, makes an excellent
substitute.</p>
<p>Your breakfast done, turn out the gas, remount the stairs
quietly, open gently the front door and slip out.&nbsp; You will
find yourself in an unknown land.&nbsp; A strange city grown
round you in the night.</p>
<p>The sweet long streets lie silent in sunlight.&nbsp; Not a
living thing is to be seen save some lean Tom that slinks from
his gutter feast as you approach.&nbsp; From some tree there will
sound perhaps a fretful chirp: but the London sparrow is no early
riser; he is but talking in his sleep.&nbsp; The slow tramp of
unseen policeman draws near or dies away.&nbsp; The clatter of
your own footsteps goes with you, troubling you.&nbsp; You find
yourself trying to walk softly, as one does in echoing
cathedrals.&nbsp; A voice is everywhere about you whispering to
you &ldquo;Hush.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is this million-breasted City then
some tender Artemis, seeking to keep her babes asleep?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hush, you careless wayfarer; do not waken them.&nbsp; Walk
lighter; they are so tired, these myriad children of mine,
sleeping in my thousand arms.&nbsp; They are over-worked and
over-worried; so many of them are sick, so many fretful, many of
them, alas, so full of naughtiness.&nbsp; But all of them so
tired.&nbsp; Hush! they worry me with their noise and riot when
they are awake.&nbsp; They are so good now they are asleep.&nbsp;
Walk lightly, let them rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where the ebbing tide flows softly through worn arches to the
sea, you may hear the stone-faced City talking to the restless
waters: &ldquo;Why will you never stay with me?&nbsp; Why come
but to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say, I do not understand.&nbsp; From the deep
sea I come, but only as a bird loosed from a child&rsquo;s hand
with a cord.&nbsp; When she calls I must return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so with these children of mine.&nbsp; They come
to me, I know not whence.&nbsp; I nurse them for a little while,
till a hand I do not see plucks them back.&nbsp; And others take
their place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the still air there passes a ripple of sound.&nbsp;
The sleeping City stirs with a faint sigh.&nbsp; A distant
milk-cart rattling by raises a thousand echoes; it is the
vanguard of a yoked army.&nbsp; Soon from every street there
rises the soothing cry,
&ldquo;Mee&rsquo;hilk&mdash;mee&rsquo;hilk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>London like some Gargantuan babe, is awake, crying for its
milk.&nbsp; These be the white-smocked nurses hastening with its
morning nourishment.&nbsp; The early church bells ring.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have had your milk, little London.&nbsp; Now come and
say your prayers.&nbsp; Another week has just begun, baby
London.&nbsp; God knows what will happen, say your
prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one the little creatures creep from behind the blinds
into the streets.&nbsp; The brooding tenderness is vanished from
the City&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The fretful noises of the day have
come again.&nbsp; Silence, her lover of the night, kisses her
stone lips, and steals away.&nbsp; And you, gentle Reader, return
home, garlanded with the self-sufficiency of the early riser.</p>
<p>But it was of a certain week-day morning, in the Strand that I
was thinking.&nbsp; I was standing outside Gatti&rsquo;s
Restaurant, where I had just breakfasted, listening leisurely to
an argument between an indignant lady passenger, presumably of
Irish extraction, and an omnibus conductor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what d&rsquo;ye want thin to paint Putney on
ye&rsquo;r bus, if ye don&rsquo;t <i>go</i> to Putney?&rdquo;
said the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>do</i> go to Putney,&rdquo; said the
conductor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin why did ye put me out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t put you out, yer got out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shure, didn&rsquo;t the gintleman in the corner tell me
I was comin&rsquo; further away from Putney ivery
minit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, and so yer was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin whoy didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was I to know yer wanted to go to Putney?&nbsp; Yer
sings out Putney, and I stops and in yer jumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for what d&rsquo;ye think I called out Putney
thin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s my name, or rayther the
bus&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; This &rsquo;ere <i>is</i> a
Putney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can it be a Putney whin it isn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to Putney, ye gomerhawk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you an Hirishwoman?&rdquo; retorted the
conductor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Course yer are.&nbsp; But yer
aren&rsquo;t always goin&rsquo; to Ireland.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to Putney in time, only we&rsquo;re a-going to
Liverpool Street fust.&nbsp; &rsquo;Igher up, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bus moved on, and I was about cross the road, when a man,
muttering savagely to himself, walked into me.&nbsp; He would
have swept past me had I not, recognizing him, arrested
him.&nbsp; It was my friend B&mdash;, a busy editor of magazines
and journals.&nbsp; It was some seconds before he appeared able
to struggle out of his abstraction, and remember himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Halloo,&rdquo; he then said, &ldquo;who would have thought
of seeing <i>you</i> here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To judge by the way you were walking,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;one would imagine the Strand the last place in which you
expected to see any human being.&nbsp; Do you ever walk into a
short-tempered, muscular man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I walk into you?&rdquo; he asked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not right in,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I if we
are to be literal.&nbsp; You walked on to me; if I had not
stopped you, I suppose you would have walked over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this confounded Christmas business,&rdquo; he
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It drives me off my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard Christmas advanced as an excuse for many
things,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but not early in
September.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;we
are in the middle of our Christmas number.&nbsp; I am working day
and night upon it.&nbsp; By the bye,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that
puts me in mind.&nbsp; I am arranging a symposium, and I want you
to join.&nbsp; &lsquo;Should Christmas,&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;I
interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I commenced my
journalistic career when I was eighteen, and I have continued it
at intervals ever since.&nbsp; I have written about Christmas
from the sentimental point of view; I have analyzed it from the
philosophical point of view; and I have scarified it from the
sarcastic standpoint.&nbsp; I have treated Christmas humorously
for the Comics, and sympathetically for the Provincial
Weeklies.&nbsp; I have said all that is worth saying on the
subject of Christmas&mdash;maybe a trifle more.&nbsp; I have told
the new-fashioned Christmas story&mdash;you know the sort of
thing: your heroine tries to understand herself, and, failing,
runs off with the man who began as the hero; your good woman
turns out to be really bad when one comes to know her; while the
villain, the only decent person in the story, dies with an
enigmatic sentence on his lips that looks as if it meant
something, but which you yourself would be sorry to have to
explain.&nbsp; I have also written the old-fashioned Christmas
story&mdash;you know that also: you begin with a good
old-fashioned snowstorm; you have a good old-fashioned squire,
and he lives in a good old-fashioned Hall; you work in a good
old-fashioned murder; and end up with a good old-fashioned
Christmas dinner.&nbsp; I have gathered Christmas guests together
round the crackling logs to tell ghost stories to each other on
Christmas Eve, while without the wind howled, as it always does
on these occasions, at its proper cue.&nbsp; I have sent children
to Heaven on Christmas Eve&mdash;it must be quite a busy time for
St. Peter, Christmas morning, so many good children die on
Christmas Eve.&nbsp; It has always been a popular night with
them.&mdash;I have revivified dead lovers and brought them back
well and jolly, just in time to sit down to the Christmas
dinner.&nbsp; I am not ashamed of having done these things.&nbsp;
At the time I thought them good.&nbsp; I once loved currant wine
and girls with towzley hair.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s views change as
one grows older.&nbsp; I have discussed Christmas as a religious
festival.&nbsp; I have arraigned it as a social incubus.&nbsp; If
there be any joke connected with Christmas that I have not
already made I should be glad to hear it.&nbsp; I have trotted
out the indigestion jokes till the sight of one of them gives me
indigestion myself.&nbsp; I have ridiculed the family
gathering.&nbsp; I have scoffed at the Christmas present.&nbsp; I
have made witty use of paterfamilias and his bills.&nbsp; I
have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I ever show you,&rdquo; I broke off to ask as we
were crossing the Haymarket, &ldquo;that little parody of mine on
Poe&rsquo;s poem of &lsquo;The Bells&rsquo;?&nbsp; It
begins&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He interrupted me in his
turn&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bills, bills, bills,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; I admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
forgot I ever showed it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never did,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you know how it begins?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for certain,&rdquo; he admitted,
&ldquo;but I get, on an average, sixty-five a year submitted to
me, and they all begin that way.&nbsp; I thought, perhaps, yours
did also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how else it could begin,&rdquo; I
retorted.&nbsp; He had rather annoyed me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides,
it doesn&rsquo;t matter how a poem begins, it is how it goes on
that is the important thing and anyhow, I&rsquo;m not going to
write you anything about Christmas.&nbsp; Ask me to make you a
new joke about a plumber; suggest my inventing something original
and not too shocking for a child to say about heaven; propose my
running you off a dog story that can be believed by a man of
average determination and we may come to terms.&nbsp; But on the
subject of Christmas I am taking a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time we had reached Piccadilly Circus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you
are as sick of the subject as I am.&nbsp; So soon as these
Christmas numbers are off my mind, and Christmas is over till
next June at the office, I shall begin it at home.&nbsp; The
housekeeping is gone up a pound a week already.&nbsp; I know what
that means.&nbsp; The dear little woman is saving up to give me
an expensive present that I don&rsquo;t want.&nbsp; I think the
presents are the worst part of Christmas.&nbsp; Emma will give me
a water-colour that she has painted herself.&nbsp; She always
does.&nbsp; There would be no harm in that if she did not expect
me to hang it in the drawing room.&nbsp; Have you ever seen my
cousin Emma&rsquo;s water-colours?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no thinking about it,&rdquo; he retorted
angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not the sort of water-colours
you forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He apostrophized the Circus generally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do people do these things?&rdquo; he
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even an amateur artist must have
<i>some</i> sense.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t they see what is
happening?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s that thing of hers hanging in the
passage.&nbsp; I put it in the passage because there&rsquo;s not
much light in the passage.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s labelled it
Reverie.&nbsp; If she had called it Influenza I could have
understood it.&nbsp; I asked her where she got the idea from, and
she said she saw the sky like that one evening in Norfolk.&nbsp;
Great Heavens! then why didn&rsquo;t she shut her eyes or go home
and hide behind the bed-curtains?&nbsp; If I had seen a sky like
that in Norfolk I should have taken the first train back to
London.&nbsp; I suppose the poor girl can&rsquo;t help seeing
these things, but why paint them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I suppose painting is a necessity to some
natures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why give the things to me?&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>
<p>I could offer him no adequate reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idiotic presents that people give you!&rdquo; he
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d like Tennyson&rsquo;s
poems one year.&nbsp; They had worried me to know what I did
want.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want anything really; that was the
only thing I could think of that I wasn&rsquo;t dead sure I
didn&rsquo;t want.&nbsp; Well, they clubbed together, four of
them, and gave me Tennyson in twelve volumes, illustrated with
coloured photographs.&nbsp; They meant kindly, of course.&nbsp;
If you suggest a tobacco-pouch they give you a blue velvet bag
capable of holding about a pound, embroidered with flowers,
life-size.&nbsp; The only way one could use it would be to put a
strap to it and wear it as a satchel.&nbsp; Would you believe it,
I have got a velvet smoking-jacket, ornamented with
forget-me-nots and butterflies in coloured silk; I&rsquo;m not
joking.&nbsp; And they ask me why I never wear it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll bring it down to the Club one of these nights and wake
the place up a bit: it needs it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had arrived by this at the steps of the
&lsquo;Devonshire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m just as bad,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;when I give presents.&nbsp; I never give them what they
want.&nbsp; I never hit upon anything that is of any use to
anybody.&nbsp; If I give Jane a chinchilla tippet, you may be
certain chinchilla is the most out-of-date fur that any woman
could wear.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! that is nice of you,&rsquo; she
says; &lsquo;now that is just the very thing I wanted.&nbsp; I
will keep it by me till chinchilla comes in again.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
give the girls watch-chains when nobody is wearing
watch-chains.&nbsp; When watch-chains are all the rage I give
them ear-rings, and they thank me, and suggest my taking them to
a fancy-dress ball, that being their only chance to wear the
confounded things.&nbsp; I waste money on white gloves with black
backs, to find that white gloves with black backs stamp a woman
as suburban.&nbsp; I believe all the shop-keepers in London save
their old stock to palm it off on me at Christmas time.&nbsp; And
why does it always take half-a-dozen people to serve you with a
pair of gloves, I&rsquo;d like to know?&nbsp; Only last week Jane
asked me to get her some gloves for that last Mansion House
affair.&nbsp; I was feeling amiable, and I thought I would do the
thing handsomely.&nbsp; I hate going into a draper&rsquo;s shop;
everybody stares at a man as if he were forcing his way into the
ladies&rsquo; department of a Turkish bath.&nbsp; One of those
marionette sort of men came up to me and said it was a fine
morning.&nbsp; What the devil did I want to talk about the
morning to him for?&nbsp; I said I wanted some gloves.&nbsp; I
described them to the best of my recollection.&nbsp; I said,
&lsquo;I want them four buttons, but they are not to be
button-gloves; the buttons are in the middle and they reach up to
the elbow, if you know what I mean.&rsquo;&nbsp; He bowed, and
said he understood exactly what I meant, which was a damned sight
more than I did.&nbsp; I told him I wanted three pair cream and
three pair fawn-coloured, and the fawn-coloured were to be
swedes.&nbsp; He corrected me.&nbsp; He said I meant
&lsquo;Suede.&rsquo;&nbsp; I dare say he was right, but the
interruption put me off, and I had to begin over again.&nbsp; He
listened attentively until I had finished.&nbsp; I guess I was
about five minutes standing with him there close to the
door.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;Is that all you require, sir, this
morning?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This way, please, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took me into another room, and there we met a man
named Jansen, to whom he briefly introduced me as a gentleman who
&lsquo;desired gloves.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said
Mr. Jansen; and what sort of gloves do you desire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him I wanted six pairs altogether&mdash;three
suede, fawn-coloured, and three cream-coloured&mdash;kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Do you mean kid gloves, sir, or gloves
for children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made me angry by that.&nbsp; I told him I was not in
the habit of using slang.&nbsp; Nor am I when buying
gloves.&nbsp; He said he was sorry.&nbsp; I explained to him
about the buttons, so far as I could understand it myself, and
about the length.&nbsp; I asked him to see to it that the buttons
were sewn on firmly, and that the stitching everywhere was
perfect, adding that the last gloves my wife had had of his firm
had been most unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Jane had impressed upon me to
add that.&nbsp; She said it would make them more careful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He listened to me in rapt ecstacy.&nbsp; I might have
been music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what size, sir?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten that.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, sixes,&rsquo; I
answered, &lsquo;unless they are very stretchy indeed, in which
case they had better be five and three-quarter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, and the stitching on the cream is to be
black,&rsquo; I added.&nbsp; That was another thing I had
forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you very much,&rsquo; said Mr. Jansen;
&lsquo;is there anything else that you require this
morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;not this
morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was beginning to like the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took me for quite a walk, and wherever we went
everybody left off what they were doing to stare at me.&nbsp; I
was getting tired when we reached the glove department.&nbsp; He
marched me up to a young man who was sticking pins into
himself.&nbsp; He said &lsquo;Gloves,&rsquo; and disappeared
through a curtain.&nbsp; The young man left off sticking pins
into himself, and leant across the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ladies&rsquo; gloves or gentlemen&rsquo;s
gloves?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was pretty mad by this time, as you can
guess.&nbsp; It is funny when you come to think of it afterwards,
but the wonder then was that I didn&rsquo;t punch his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Are you ever busy in this shop?&nbsp;
Does there ever come a time when you feel you would like to get
your work done, instead of lingering over it and spinning it out
for pure love of the thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not appear to understand me.&nbsp; I said,
&lsquo;I met a man at your door a quarter of an hour ago, and we
talked about these gloves that I want, and I told him all my
ideas on the subject.&nbsp; He took me to your Mr. Jansen, and
Mr. Jansen and I went over the whole business again.&nbsp; Now
Mr. Jansen leaves it with you&mdash;you who do not even know
whether I want ladies&rsquo; or gentlemen&rsquo;s gloves.&nbsp;
Before I go over this story for the third time, I want to know
whether you are the man who is going to serve me, or whether you
are merely a listener, because personally I am tired of the
subject?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this was the right man at last, and I got my
gloves from him.&nbsp; But what is the explanation&mdash;what is
the idea?&nbsp; I was in that shop from first to last
five-and-thirty minutes.&nbsp; And then a fool took me out the
wrong way to show me a special line in sleeping-socks.&nbsp; I
told him I was not requiring any.&nbsp; He said he didn&rsquo;t
want me to buy, he only wanted me to see them.&nbsp; No wonder
the drapers have had to start luncheon and tea-rooms.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll fix up small furnished flats soon, where a woman
can live for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said it was very trying, shopping.&nbsp; I also said, as he
invited me, and as he appeared determined to go on talking, that
I would have a brandy-and-soda.&nbsp; We were in the smoke-room
by this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ought to be an association,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;a kind of clearing-house for the collection and
distribution of Christmas presents.&nbsp; One would give them a
list of the people from whom to collect presents, and of the
people to whom to send.&nbsp; Suppose they collected on my
account twenty Christmas presents, value, say, ten pounds, while
on the other hand they sent out for me thirty presents at a cost
of fifteen pounds.&nbsp; They would debit me with the balance of
five pounds, together with a small commission.&nbsp; I should pay
it cheerfully, and there would be no further trouble.&nbsp;
Perhaps one might even make a profit.&nbsp; The idea might
include birthdays and weddings.&nbsp; A firm would do the
business thoroughly.&nbsp; They would see that all your friends
paid up&mdash;I mean sent presents; and they would not forget to
send to your most important relative.&nbsp; There is only one
member of our family capable of leaving a shilling; and of course
if I forget to send to any one it is to him.&nbsp; When I
remember him I generally make a muddle of the business.&nbsp; Two
years ago I gave him a bath&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean I washed
him&mdash;an india-rubber thing, that he could pack in his
portmanteau.&nbsp; I thought he would find it useful for
travelling.&nbsp; Would you believe it, he took it as a personal
affront, and wouldn&rsquo;t speak to me for a month, the snuffy
old idiot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the children enjoy it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enjoy what?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Christmas,&rdquo; I explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they do,&rdquo; he snapped;
&ldquo;nobody enjoys it.&nbsp; We excite them for three weeks
beforehand, telling them what a good time they are going to have,
over-feed them for two or three days, take them to something they
do not want to see, but which we do, and then bully them for a
fortnight to get them back into their normal condition.&nbsp; I
was always taken to the Crystal Palace and Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s
when I was a child, I remember.&nbsp; How I did hate that Crystal
Palace!&nbsp; Aunt used to superintend.&nbsp; It was always a
bitterly cold day, and we always got into the wrong train, and
travelled half the day before we got there.&nbsp; We never had
any dinner.&nbsp; It never occurs to a woman that anybody can
want their meals while away from home.&nbsp; She seems to think
that nature is in suspense from the time you leave the house till
the time you get back to it.&nbsp; A bun and a glass of milk was
her idea of lunch for a school-boy.&nbsp; Half her time was taken
up in losing us, and the other half in slapping us when she had
found us.&nbsp; The only thing we really enjoyed was the row with
the cabman coming home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t join that symposium?&rdquo; said
B&mdash;.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be an easy enough thing to knock
off&mdash;&lsquo;Why Christmas should be
abolished.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds simple,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
how do you propose to abolish it?&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady editor of
an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; American magazine once set the
discussion&mdash;&ldquo;Should sex be abolished?&rdquo; and
eleven ladies and gentlemen seriously argued the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to die of inanition,&rdquo; said B&mdash;;
&ldquo;the first step is to arouse public opinion.&nbsp; Convince
the public that it should be abolished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should it be abolished?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! man,&rdquo; he exclaimed;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want it abolished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I do,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sure,&rdquo; he retorted; &ldquo;you call yourself
a journalist, and admit there is a subject under Heaven of which
you are not sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has come over me of late years,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It used not to be my failing, as you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced round to make sure we were out of earshot, then
sunk his voice to a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between ourselves,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
so sure of everything myself as I used to be.&nbsp; Why is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we are getting older,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>He said&mdash;&ldquo;I started golf last year, and the first
time I took the club in my hand I sent the ball a furlong.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It seems an easy game,&rsquo; I said to the man who was
teaching me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, most people find it easy at the
beginning,&rsquo; he replied dryly.&nbsp; He was an old golfer
himself; I thought he was jealous.&nbsp; I stuck well to the
game, and for about three weeks I was immensely pleased with
myself.&nbsp; Then, gradually, I began to find out the
difficulties.&nbsp; I feel I shall never make a good
player.&nbsp; Have you ever gone through that
experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I suppose that is the
explanation.&nbsp; The game seems so easy at the
beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left him to his lunch, and strolled westward, musing on the
time when I should have answered that question of his about
Christmas, or any other question, off-hand.&nbsp; That good youth
time when I knew everything, when life presented no problems,
dangled no doubts before me!</p>
<p>In those days, wishful to give the world the benefit of my
wisdom, and seeking for a candle-stick wherefrom my brilliancy
might be visible and helpful unto men, I arrived before a dingy
portal in Chequers Street, St. Luke&rsquo;s, behind which a
conclave of young men, together with a few old enough to have
known better, met every Friday evening for the purpose of
discussing and arranging the affairs of the universe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Speaking members&rdquo; were charged ten-and-sixpence per
annum, which must have worked out at an extremely moderate rate
per word; and &ldquo;gentlemen whose subscriptions were more than
three months in arrear,&rdquo; became, by Rule seven, powerless
for good or evil.&nbsp; We called ourselves &ldquo;The Stormy
Petrels,&rdquo; and, under the sympathetic shadow of those wings,
I laboured two seasons towards the reformation of the human race;
until, indeed, our treasurer, an earnest young man, and a
tireless foe of all that was conventional, departed for the East,
leaving behind him a balance sheet, showing that the club owed
forty-two pounds fifteen and fourpence, and that the
subscriptions for the current year, amounting to a little over
thirty-eight pounds, had been &ldquo;carried forward,&rdquo; but
as to where, the report afforded no indication.&nbsp; Whereupon
our landlord, a man utterly without ideals, seized our furniture,
offering to sell it back to us for fifteen pounds.&nbsp; We
pointed out to him that this was an extravagant price, and
tendered him five.</p>
<p>The negotiations terminated with ungentlemanly language on his
part, and &ldquo;The Stormy Petrels&rdquo; scattered, never to be
foregathered together again above the troubled waters of
humanity.&nbsp; Now-a-days, listening to the feeble plans of
modern reformers, I cannot help but smile, remembering what was
done in Chequers Street, St. Luke&rsquo;s, in an age when Mrs.
Grundy still gave the law to literature, while yet the British
matron was the guide to British art.&nbsp; I am informed that
there is abroad the question of abolishing the House of
Lords!&nbsp; Why, &ldquo;The Stormy Petrels&rdquo; abolished the
aristocracy and the Crown in one evening, and then only adjourned
for the purpose of appointing a committee to draw up and have
ready a Republican Constitution by the following Friday
evening.&nbsp; They talk of Empire lounges!&nbsp; We closed the
doors of every music-hall in London eighteen years ago by
twenty-nine votes to seventeen.&nbsp; They had a patient hearing,
and were ably defended; but we found that the tendency of such
amusements was anti-progressive, and against the best interests
of an intellectually advancing democracy.&nbsp; I met the mover
of the condemnatory resolution at the old &ldquo;Pav&rdquo; the
following evening, and we continued the discussion over a bottle
of Bass.&nbsp; He strengthened his argument by persuading me to
sit out the whole of the three songs sung by the &ldquo;Lion
Comique&rdquo;; but I subsequently retorted successfully, by
bringing under his notice the dancing of a lady in blue tights
and flaxen hair.&nbsp; I forget her name but never shall I cease
to remember her exquisite charm and beauty.&nbsp; Ah, me! how
charming and how beautiful &ldquo;artistes&rdquo; were in those
golden days!&nbsp; Whence have they vanished?&nbsp; Ladies in
blue tights and flaxen hair dance before my eyes to-day, but move
me not, unless it be towards boredom.&nbsp; Where be the tripping
witches of twenty years ago, whom to see once was to dream of for
a week, to touch whose white hand would have been joy, to kiss
whose red lips would have been to foretaste Heaven.&nbsp; I heard
only the other day that the son of an old friend of mine had
secretly married a lady from the front row of the ballet, and
involuntarily I exclaimed, &ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was a time when my first thought would have been, &ldquo;Lucky
beggar! is he worthy of her?&rdquo;&nbsp; For then the ladies of
the ballet were angels.&nbsp; How could one gaze at
them&mdash;from the shilling pit&mdash;and doubt it?&nbsp; They
danced to keep a widowed mother in comfort, or to send a younger
brother to school.&nbsp; Then they were glorious creatures a
young man did well to worship; but now-a-days&mdash;</p>
<p>It is an old jest.&nbsp; The eyes of youth see through
rose-tinted glasses.&nbsp; The eyes of age are dim behind
smoke-clouded spectacles.&nbsp; My flaxen friend, you are not the
angel I dreamed you, nor the exceptional sinner some would paint
you; but under your feathers, just a woman&mdash;a bundle of
follies and failings, tied up with some sweetness and
strength.&nbsp; You keep a brougham I am sure you cannot afford
on your thirty shillings a week.&nbsp; There are ladies I know,
in Mayfair, who have paid an extravagant price for theirs.&nbsp;
You paint and you dye, I am told: it is even hinted you
pad.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t we all of us deck ourselves out in virtues
that are not our own?&nbsp; When the paint and the powder, my
sister, is stripped both from you and from me, we shall know
which of us is entitled to look down on the other in scorn.</p>
<p>Forgive me, gentle Reader, for digressing.&nbsp; The lady led
me astray.&nbsp; I was speaking of &ldquo;The Stormy
Petrels,&rdquo; and of the reforms they accomplished, which were
many.&nbsp; We abolished, I remember, capital punishment and war;
we were excellent young men at heart.&nbsp; Christmas we reformed
altogether, along with Bank Holidays, by a majority of
twelve.&nbsp; I never recollect any proposal to abolish anything
ever being lost when put to the vote.&nbsp; There were few things
that we &ldquo;Stormy Petrels&rdquo; did not abolish.&nbsp; We
attacked Christmas on grounds of expediency, and killed it by
ridicule.&nbsp; We exposed the hollow mockery of Christmas
sentiment; we abused the indigestible Christmas dinner, the
tiresome Christmas party, the silly Christmas pantomime.&nbsp;
Our funny member was side-splitting on the subject of Christmas
Waits; our social reformer bitter upon Christmas drunkenness; our
economist indignant upon Christmas charities.&nbsp; Only one
argument of any weight with us was advanced in favour of the
festival, and that was our leading cynic&rsquo;s suggestion that
it was worth enduring the miseries of Christmas, to enjoy the
soul-satisfying comfort of the after reflection that it was all
over, and could not occur again for another year.</p>
<p>But since those days when I was prepared to put this old world
of ours to rights upon all matters, I have seen many sights and
heard many sounds, and I am not quite so sure as I once was that
my particular views are the only possibly correct ones.&nbsp;
Christmas seems to me somewhat meaningless; but I have looked
through windows in poverty-stricken streets, and have seen dingy
parlours gay with many chains of coloured paper.&nbsp; They
stretched from corner to corner of the smoke-grimed ceiling, they
fell in clumsy festoons from the cheap gasalier, they framed the
fly-blown mirror and the tawdry pictures; and I know tired hands
and eyes worked many hours to fashion and fix those foolish
chains, saying, &ldquo;It will please him&mdash;she will like to
see the room look pretty;&rdquo; and as I have looked at them
they have grown, in some mysterious manner, beautiful to
me.&nbsp; The gaudy-coloured child and dog irritates me, I
confess; but I have watched a grimy, inartistic personage,
smoothing it affectionately with toil-stained hand, while eager
faces crowded round to admire and wonder at its blatant
crudity.&nbsp; It hangs to this day in its cheap frame above the
chimney-piece, the one bright spot relieving those damp-stained
walls; dull eyes stare and stare again at it, catching a vista,
through its flashy tints, of the far-off land of art.&nbsp;
Christmas Waits annoy me, and I yearn to throw open the window
and fling coal at them&mdash;as once from the window of a high
flat in Chelsea I did.&nbsp; I doubted their being genuine
Waits.&nbsp; I was inclined to the opinion they were young men
seeking excuse for making a noise.&nbsp; One of them appeared to
know a hymn with a chorus, another played the concertina, while a
third accompanied with a step dance.&nbsp; Instinctively I felt
no respect for them; they disturbed me in my work, and the desire
grew upon me to injure them.&nbsp; It occurred to me it would be
good sport if I turned out the light, softly opened the window,
and threw coal at them.&nbsp; It would be impossible for them to
tell from which window in the block the coal came, and thus
subsequent unpleasantness would be avoided.&nbsp; They were a
compact little group, and with average luck I was bound to hit
one of them.</p>
<p>I adopted the plan.&nbsp; I could not see them very
clearly.&nbsp; I aimed rather at the noise; and I had thrown
about twenty choice lumps without effect, and was feeling
somewhat discouraged, when a yell, followed by language
singularly unappropriate to the season, told me that Providence
had aided my arm.&nbsp; The music ceased suddenly, and the party
dispersed, apparently in high glee&mdash;which struck me as
curious.</p>
<p>One man I noticed remained behind.&nbsp; He stood under the
lamp-post, and shook his fist at the block generally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who threw that lump of coal?&rdquo; he demanded in
stentorian tones.</p>
<p>To my horror, it was the voice of the man at Eighty-eight, an
Irish gentleman, a journalist like myself.&nbsp; I saw it all, as
the unfortunate hero always exclaims, too late, in the
play.&nbsp; He&mdash;number Eighty-eight&mdash;also disturbed by
the noise, had evidently gone out to expostulate with the
rioters.&nbsp; Of course my lump of coal had hit him&mdash;him
the innocent, the peaceful (up till then), the virtuous.&nbsp;
That is the justice Fate deals out to us mortals here
below.&nbsp; There were ten to fourteen young men in that crowd,
each one of whom fully deserved that lump of coal; he, the one
guiltless, got it&mdash;seemingly, so far as the dim light from
the gas lamp enabled me to judge, full in the eye.</p>
<p>As the block remained silent in answer to his demand, he
crossed the road and mounted the stairs.&nbsp; On each landing he
stopped and shouted&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who threw that lump of coal?&nbsp; I want the man who
threw that lump of coal.&nbsp; Out you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now a good man in my place would have waited till number
Eighty-eight arrived on his landing, and then, throwing open the
door would have said with manly candour&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> threw that lump of coal.&nbsp; I
was&mdash;,&rdquo;&nbsp; He would not have got further, because
at that point, I feel confident, number Eighty&mdash;eight would
have punched his head.&nbsp; There would have been an unseemly
fracas on the staircase, to the annoyance of all the other
tenants and later, there would have issued a summons and a
cross-summons.&nbsp; Angry passions would have been roused,
bitter feeling engendered which might have lasted for years.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to be a good man.&nbsp; I doubt if the
pretence would be of any use were I to try: I am not a
sufficiently good actor.&nbsp; I said to myself, as I took off my
boots in the study, preparatory to retiring to my
bedroom&mdash;&ldquo;Number Eighty-eight is evidently not in a
frame of mind to listen to my story.&nbsp; It will be better to
let him shout himself cool; after which he will return to his own
flat, bathe his eye, and obtain some refreshing sleep.&nbsp; In
the morning, when we shall probably meet as usual on our way to
Fleet Street, I will refer to the incident casually, and
sympathize with him.&nbsp; I will suggest to him the
truth&mdash;that in all probability some fellow-tenant, irritated
also by the noise, had aimed coal at the Waits, hitting him
instead by a regrettable but pure accident.&nbsp; With tact I may
even be able to make him see the humour of the incident.&nbsp;
Later on, in March or April, choosing my moment with judgment, I
will, perhaps, confess that I was that fellow-tenant, and over a
friendly brandy-and-soda we will laugh the whole trouble
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, that is what happened.&nbsp; Said number
Eighty-eight&mdash;he was a big man, as good a fellow at heart as
ever lived, but impulsive&mdash;&ldquo;Damned lucky for you, old
man, you did not tell me at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;instinctively that it
was a case for delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are times when one should control one&rsquo;s passion
for candour; and as I was saying, Christmas waits excite no
emotion in my breast save that of irritation.&nbsp; But I have
known &ldquo;Hark, the herald angels sing,&rdquo; wheezily
chanted by fog-filled throats, and accompanied, hopelessly out of
tune, by a cornet and a flute, bring a great look of gladness to
a work-worn face.&nbsp; To her it was a message of hope and love,
making the hard life taste sweet.&nbsp; The mere thought of
family gatherings, so customary at Christmas time, bores us
superior people; but I think of an incident told me by a certain
man, a friend of mine.&nbsp; One Christmas, my friend, visiting
in the country, came face to face with a woman whom in town he
had often met amid very different surroundings.&nbsp; The door of
the little farmhouse was open; she and an older woman were
ironing at a table, and as her soft white hands passed to and
fro, folding and smoothing the rumpled heap, she laughed and
talked, concerning simple homely things.&nbsp; My friend&rsquo;s
shadow fell across her work, and she looking up, their eyes met;
but her face said plainly, &ldquo;I do not know you here, and
here you do not know me.&nbsp; Here I am a woman loved and
respected.&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend passed in and spoke to the
older woman, the wife of one of his host&rsquo;s tenants, and she
turned towards, and introduced the younger&mdash;&ldquo;My
daughter, sir.&nbsp; We do not see her very often.&nbsp; She is
in a place in London, and cannot get away.&nbsp; But she always
spends a few days with us at Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the season for family re-unions,&rdquo; answered
my friend with just the suggestion of a sneer, for which he hated
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the woman, not noticing;
&ldquo;she has never missed her Christmas with us, have you,
Bess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; replied the girl simply, and bent
her head again over her work.</p>
<p>So for these few days every year this woman left her furs and
jewels, her fine clothes and dainty foods, behind her, and lived
for a little space with what was clean and wholesome.&nbsp; It
was the one anchor holding her to womanhood; and one likes to
think that it was, perhaps, in the end strong enough to save her
from the drifting waters.&nbsp; All which arguments in favour of
Christmas and of Christmas customs are, I admit, purely
sentimental ones, but I have lived long enough to doubt whether
sentiment has not its legitimate place in the economy of
life.</p>
<h2><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>ON
THE TIME WASTED IN LOOKING BEFORE ONE LEAPS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> you ever noticed the going out
of a woman?</p>
<p>When a man goes out, he says&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out,
shan&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, George,&rdquo; cries his wife from the other end of
the house, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go for a moment.&nbsp; I want you
to&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She hears a falling of hats, followed by
the slamming of the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, George, you&rsquo;re not gone!&rdquo; she
wails.&nbsp; It is but the voice of despair.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact, she knows he is gone.&nbsp; She reaches the hall,
breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have waited a minute,&rdquo; she mutters to
herself, as she picks up the hats, &ldquo;there were so many
things I wanted him to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She does not open the door and attempt to stop him, she knows
he is already half-way down the street.&nbsp; It is a mean,
paltry way of going out, she thinks; so like a man.</p>
<p>When a woman, on the other hand, goes out, people know about
it.&nbsp; She does not sneak out.&nbsp; She says she is going
out.&nbsp; She says it, generally, on the afternoon of the day
before; and she repeats it, at intervals, until tea-time.&nbsp;
At tea, she suddenly decides that she won&rsquo;t, that she will
leave it till the day after to-morrow instead.&nbsp; An hour
later she thinks she will go to-morrow, after all, and makes
arrangements to wash her hair overnight.&nbsp; For the next hour
or so she alternates between fits of exaltation, during which she
looks forward to going out, and moments of despondency, when a
sense of foreboding falls upon her.&nbsp; At dinner she persuades
some other woman to go with her; the other woman, once persuaded,
is enthusiastic about going, until she recollects that she
cannot.&nbsp; The first woman, however, convinces her that she
can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replies the second woman, &ldquo;but then,
how about you, dear?&nbsp; You are forgetting the
Joneses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was,&rdquo; answers the first woman, completely
non-plussed.&nbsp; &ldquo;How very awkward, and I can&rsquo;t go
on Wednesday.&nbsp; I shall have to leave it till Thursday,
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t go Thursday,&rdquo; says the
second woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you go without me, dear,&rdquo; says the first
woman, in the tone of one who is sacrificing a life&rsquo;s
ambition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, dear, I should not think of it,&rdquo; nobly
exclaims the second woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will wait and go
together, Friday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; says
the first woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will start early&rdquo; (this is
an inspiration), &ldquo;and be back before the Joneses
arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They agree to sleep together; there is a lurking suspicion in
both their minds that this may be their last sleep on
earth.&nbsp; They retire early with a can of hot water.&nbsp; At
intervals, during the night, one overhears them splashing water,
and talking.</p>
<p>They come down very late for breakfast, and both very
cross.&nbsp; Each seems to have argued herself into the belief
that she has been lured into this piece of nonsense, against her
better judgment, by the persistent folly of the other one.&nbsp;
During the meal each one asks the other, every five minutes, if
she is quite ready.&nbsp; Each one, it appears, has only her hat
to put on.&nbsp; They talk about the weather, and wonder what it
is going to do.&nbsp; They wish it would make up its mind, one
way or the other.&nbsp; They are very bitter on weather that
cannot make up its mind.&nbsp; After breakfast it still looks
cloudy, and they decide to abandon the scheme altogether.&nbsp;
The first woman then remembers that it is absolutely necessary
for her, at all events, to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no need for you to come, dear,&rdquo; she
says.</p>
<p>Up to that point the second woman was evidently not sure
whether she wished to go or whether she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Now
she knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;then
it will be over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; urges the
first woman, &ldquo;and I shall be quicker by myself.&nbsp; I am
ready to start now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second woman bridles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> shan&rsquo;t be a couple of minutes,&rdquo;
she retorts.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know, dear, it&rsquo;s generally
<i>I</i> who have to wait for <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve not got your boots on,&rdquo; the
first woman reminds her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they won&rsquo;t take <i>any</i> time,&rdquo; is
the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;But of course, dear, if you&rsquo;d
really rather I did not come, say so.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this time
she is on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I would like you to come, dear,&rdquo;
explains the first in a resigned tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought
perhaps you were only coming to please me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;d <i>like</i> to come,&rdquo; says the
second woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must hurry up,&rdquo; says the first; &ldquo;I
shan&rsquo;t be more than a minute myself, I&rsquo;ve merely got
to change my skirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half-an-hour later you hear them calling to each other, from
different parts of the house, to know if the other one is
ready.&nbsp; It appears they have both been ready for quite a
long while, waiting only for the other one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; calls out the one whose turn
it is to be down-stairs, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to
rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; calls back the other
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks very like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a nuisance,&rdquo; answers the up-stairs woman;
&ldquo;shall we put it off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do <i>you</i> think, dear?&rdquo; replies
the down-stairs.</p>
<p>They decide they will go, only now they will have to change
their boots, and put on different hats.</p>
<p>For the next ten minutes they are still shouting and running
about.&nbsp; Then it seems as if they really were ready, nothing
remaining but for them to say &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; and go.</p>
<p>They begin by kissing the children.&nbsp; A woman never leaves
her house without secret misgivings that she will never return to
it alive.&nbsp; One child cannot be found.&nbsp; When it is found
it wishes it hadn&rsquo;t been.&nbsp; It has to be washed,
preparatory to being kissed.&nbsp; After that, the dog has to be
found and kissed, and final instructions given to the cook.</p>
<p>Then they open the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, George,&rdquo; calls out the first woman, turning
round again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; answers a voice from the distance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you want me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, only to say good-bye.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, dear.&nbsp; Do you think it&rsquo;s going to
rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I should not say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got any money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later they come running back; the one has
forgotten her parasol, the other her purse.</p>
<p>And speaking of purses, reminds one of another essential
difference between the male and female human animal.&nbsp; A man
carries his money in his pocket.&nbsp; When he wants to use it,
he takes it out and lays it down.&nbsp; This is a crude way of
doing things, a woman displays more subtlety.&nbsp; Say she is
standing in the street, and wants fourpence to pay for a bunch of
violets she has purchased from a flower-girl.&nbsp; She has two
parcels in one hand, and a parasol in the other.&nbsp; With the
remaining two fingers of the left hand she secures the
violets.&nbsp; The question then arises, how to pay the
girl?&nbsp; She flutters for a few minutes, evidently not quite
understanding why it is she cannot do it.&nbsp; The reason then
occurs to her: she has only two hands and both these are
occupied.&nbsp; First she thinks she will put the parcels and the
flowers into her right hand, then she thinks she will put the
parasol into her left.&nbsp; Then she looks round for a table or
even a chair, but there is not such a thing in the whole
street.&nbsp; Her difficulty is solved by her dropping the
parcels and the flowers.&nbsp; The girl picks them up for her and
holds them.&nbsp; This enables her to feel for her pocket with
her right hand, while waving her open parasol about with her
left.&nbsp; She knocks an old gentleman&rsquo;s hat off into the
gutter, and nearly blinds the flower-girl before it occurs to her
to close it.&nbsp; This done, she leans it up against the
flower-girl&rsquo;s basket, and sets to work in earnest with both
hands.&nbsp; She seizes herself firmly by the back, and turns the
upper part of her body round till her hair is in front and her
eyes behind.&nbsp; Still holding herself firmly with her left
hand&mdash;did she let herself go, goodness knows where she would
spin to;&mdash;with her right she prospects herself.&nbsp; The
purse is there, she can feel it, the problem is how to get at
it.&nbsp; The quickest way would, of course, be to take off the
skirt, sit down on the kerb, turn it inside out, and work from
the bottom of the pocket upwards.&nbsp; But this simple idea
never seems to occur to her.&nbsp; There are some thirty folds at
the back of the dress, between two of these folds commences the
secret passage.&nbsp; At last, purely by chance, she suddenly
discovers it, nearly upsetting herself in the process, and the
purse is brought up to the surface.&nbsp; The difficulty of
opening it still remains.&nbsp; She knows it opens with a spring,
but the secret of that spring she has never mastered, and she
never will.&nbsp; Her plan is to worry it generally until it does
open.&nbsp; Five minutes will always do it, provided she is not
flustered.</p>
<p>At last it does open.&nbsp; It would be incorrect to say that
she opens it.&nbsp; It opens because it is sick of being mauled
about; and, as likely as not, it opens at the moment when she is
holding it upside down.&nbsp; If you happen to be near enough to
look over her shoulder, you will notice that the gold and silver
lies loose within it.&nbsp; In an inner sanctuary, carefully
secured with a second secret spring, she keeps her coppers,
together with a postage-stamp and a draper&rsquo;s receipt, nine
months old, for elevenpence three-farthings.</p>
<p>I remember the indignation of an old Bus-conductor,
once.&nbsp; Inside we were nine women and two men.&nbsp; I sat
next the door, and his remarks therefore he addressed to
me.&nbsp; It was certainly taking him some time to collect the
fares, but I think he would have got on better had he been less
bustling; he worried them, and made them nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; he said, drawing my attention to a
poor lady opposite, who was diving in the customary manner for
her purse, &ldquo;they sit on their money, women do.&nbsp; Blest
if you wouldn&rsquo;t think they was trying to &rsquo;atch
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length the lady drew from underneath herself an exceedingly
fat purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy riding in a bumpby bus, perched up on that
thing,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think what a stamina
they must have.&rdquo;&nbsp; He grew confidential.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen one woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;pull out
from underneath &rsquo;er a street doorkey, a tin box of
lozengers, a pencil-case, a whopping big purse, a packet of
hair-pins, and a smelling-bottle.&nbsp; Why, you or me would be
wretched, sitting on a plain door-knob, and them women goes about
like that all day.&nbsp; I suppose they gets used to it.&nbsp;
Drop &rsquo;em on an eider-down pillow, and they&rsquo;d
scream.&nbsp; The time it takes me to get tuppence out of them,
why, it&rsquo;s &rsquo;eart-breaking.&nbsp; First they tries one
side, then they tries the other.&nbsp; Then they gets up and
shakes theirselves till the bus jerks them back again, and there
they are, a more &rsquo;opeless &rsquo;eap than ever.&nbsp; If I
&rsquo;ad my way I&rsquo;d make every bus carry a female searcher
as could over&rsquo;aul &rsquo;em one at a time, and take the
money from &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Talk about the poor pickpocket.&nbsp;
What I say is, that a man as finds his way into a woman&rsquo;s
pocket&mdash;well, he deserves what he gets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was the thought of more serious matters that lured me
into reflections concerning the over-carefulness of women.&nbsp;
It is a theory of mine&mdash;wrong possibly; indeed I have so
been informed&mdash;that we pick our way through life with too
much care.&nbsp; We are for ever looking down upon the
ground.&nbsp; Maybe, we do avoid a stumble or two over a stone or
a brier, but also we miss the blue of the sky, the glory of the
hills.&nbsp; These books that good men write, telling us that
what they call &ldquo;success&rdquo; in life depends on our
flinging aside our youth and wasting our manhood in order that we
may have the means when we are eighty of spending a rollicking
old age, annoy me.&nbsp; We save all our lives to invest in a
South Sea Bubble; and in skimping and scheming, we have grown
mean, and narrow, and hard.&nbsp; We will put off the gathering
of the roses till to-morrow, to-day it shall be all work, all
bargain-driving, all plotting.&nbsp; Lo, when to-morrow comes,
the roses are blown; nor do we care for roses, idle things of
small marketable value; cabbages are more to our fancy by the
time to-morrow comes.</p>
<p>Life is a thing to be lived, not spent, to be faced, not
ordered.&nbsp; Life is not a game of chess, the victory to the
most knowing; it is a game of cards, one&rsquo;s hand by skill to
be made the best of.&nbsp; Is it the wisest who is always the
most successful?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; The luckiest
whist-player I ever came across was a man who was never
<i>quite</i> certain what were trumps, and whose most frequent
observation during the game was &ldquo;I really beg your
pardon,&rdquo; addressed to his partner; a remark which generally
elicited the reply, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t apologize.&nbsp;
All&rsquo;s well that ends well.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man I knew who
made the most rapid fortune was a builder in the outskirts of
Birmingham, who could not write his name, and who, for thirty
years of his life, never went to bed sober.&nbsp; I do not say
that forgetfulness of trumps should be cultivated by
whist-players.&nbsp; I think my builder friend might have been
even more successful had he learned to write his name, and had he
occasionally&mdash;not overdoing it&mdash;enjoyed a sober
evening.&nbsp; All I wish to impress is, that virtue is not the
road to success&mdash;of the kind we are dealing with.&nbsp; We
must find other reasons for being virtuous; maybe, there are
some.&nbsp; The truth is, life is a gamble pure and simple, and
the rules we lay down for success are akin to the infallible
systems with which a certain class of idiot goes armed each
season to Monte Carlo.&nbsp; We can play the game with coolness
and judgment, decide when to plunge and when to stake small; but
to think that wisdom will decide it, is to imagine that we have
discovered the law of chance.&nbsp; Let us play the game of life
as sportsmen, pocketing our winnings with a smile, leaving our
losings with a shrug.&nbsp; Perhaps that is why we have been
summoned to the board and the cards dealt round: that we may
learn some of the virtues of the good gambler; his self-control,
his courage under misfortune, his modesty under the strain of
success, his firmness, his alertness, his general indifference to
fate.&nbsp; Good lessons these, all of them.&nbsp; If by the game
we learn some of them our time on the green earth has not been
wasted.&nbsp; If we rise from the table having learned only
fretfulness and self-pity I fear it has been.</p>
<p>The grim Hall Porter taps at the door: &ldquo;Number Five
hundred billion and twenty-eight, your boatman is waiting,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So! is it time already?&nbsp; We pick up our counters.&nbsp;
Of what use are they?&nbsp; In the country the other side of the
river they are no tender.&nbsp; The blood-red for gold, and the
pale-green for love, to whom shall we fling them?&nbsp; Here is
some poor beggar longing to play, let us give them to him as we
pass out.&nbsp; Poor devil! the game will amuse him&mdash;for a
while.</p>
<p>Keep your powder dry, and trust in Providence, is the motto of
the wise.&nbsp; Wet powder could never be of any possible use to
you.&nbsp; Dry, it may be, <i>with</i> the help of
Providence.&nbsp; We will call it Providence, it is a prettier
name than Chance&mdash;perhaps also a truer.</p>
<p>Another mistake we make when we reason out our lives is this:
we reason as though we were planning for reasonable
creatures.&nbsp; It is a big mistake.&nbsp; Well-meaning ladies
and gentlemen make it when they picture their ideal worlds.&nbsp;
When marriage is reformed, and the social problem solved, when
poverty and war have been abolished by acclamation, and sin and
sorrow rescinded by an overwhelming parliamentary majority!&nbsp;
Ah, then the world will be worthy of our living in it.&nbsp; You
need not wait, ladies and gentlemen, so long as you think for
that time.&nbsp; No social revolution is needed, no slow
education of the people is necessary.&nbsp; It would all come
about to-morrow, <i>if only we were reasonable creatures</i>.</p>
<p>Imagine a world of reasonable beings!&nbsp; The Ten
Commandments would be unnecessary: no reasoning being sins, no
reasoning creature makes mistakes.&nbsp; There would be no rich
men, for what reasonable man cares for luxury and
ostentation?&nbsp; There would be no poor: that I should eat
enough for two while my brother in the next street, as good a man
as I, starves, is not reasonable.&nbsp; There would be no
difference of opinion on any two points: there is only one
reason.&nbsp; You, dear Reader, would find, that on all subjects
you were of the same opinion as I.&nbsp; No novels would be
written, no plays performed; the lives of reasonable creatures do
not afford drama.&nbsp; No mad loves, no mad laughter, no
scalding tears, no fierce unreasoning, brief-lived joys, no
sorrows, no wild dreams&mdash;only reason, reason everywhere.</p>
<p>But for the present we remain unreasonable.&nbsp; If I eat
this mayonnaise, drink this champagne, I shall suffer in my
liver.&nbsp; Then, why do I eat it?&nbsp; Julia is a charming
girl, amiable, wise, and witty; also she has a share in a
brewery.&nbsp; Then, why does John marry Ann? who is
short-tempered, to say the least of it, who, he feels, will not
make him so good a house-wife, who has extravagant notions, who
has no little fortune.&nbsp; There is something about Ann&rsquo;s
chin that fascinates him&mdash;he could not explain to you
what.&nbsp; On the whole, Julia is the better-looking of the
two.&nbsp; But the more he thinks of Julia, the more he is drawn
towards Ann.&nbsp; So Tom marries Julia and the brewery fails,
and Julia, on a holiday, contracts rheumatic fever, and is a
helpless invalid for life; while Ann comes in for ten thousand
pounds left to her by an Australian uncle no one had ever heard
of.</p>
<p>I have been told of a young man, who chose his wife with
excellent care.&nbsp; Said he to himself, very wisely, &ldquo;In
the selection of a wife a man cannot be too
circumspect.&rdquo;&nbsp; He convinced himself that the girl was
everything a helpmate should be.&nbsp; She had every virtue that
could be expected in a woman, no faults, but such as are
inseparable from a woman.&nbsp; Speaking practically, she was
perfection.&nbsp; He married her, and found she was all he had
thought her.&nbsp; Only one thing could he urge against
her&mdash;that he did not like her.&nbsp; And that, of course,
was not her fault.</p>
<p>How easy life would be did we know ourselves.&nbsp; Could we
always be sure that to-morrow we should think as we do
to-day.&nbsp; We fall in love during a summer holiday; she is
fresh, delightful, altogether charming; the blood rushes to our
head every time we think of her.&nbsp; Our ideal career is one of
perpetual service at her feet.&nbsp; It seems impossible that
Fate could bestow upon us any greater happiness than the
privilege of cleaning her boots, and kissing the hem of her
garment&mdash;if the hem be a little muddy that will please us
the more.&nbsp; We tell her our ambition, and at that moment
every word we utter is sincere.&nbsp; But the summer holiday
passes, and with it the holiday mood, and winter finds us
wondering how we are going to get out of the difficulty into
which we have landed ourselves.&nbsp; Or worse still, perhaps,
the mood lasts longer than is usual.&nbsp; We become formally
engaged.&nbsp; We marry&mdash;I wonder how many marriages are the
result of a passion that is burnt out before the altar-rails are
reached?&mdash;and three months afterwards the little lass is
broken-hearted to find that we consider the lacing of her boots a
bore.&nbsp; Her feet seem to have grown bigger.&nbsp; There is no
excuse for us, save that we are silly children, never sure of
what we are crying for, hurting one another in our play, crying
very loudly when hurt ourselves.</p>
<p>I knew an American lady once who used to bore me with long
accounts of the brutalities exercised upon her by her
husband.&nbsp; She had instituted divorce proceedings against
him.&nbsp; The trial came on, and she was highly
successful.&nbsp; We all congratulated her, and then for some
months she dropped out of my life.&nbsp; But there came a day
when we again found ourselves together.&nbsp; One of the problems
of social life is to know what to say to one another when we
meet; every man and woman&rsquo;s desire is to appear sympathetic
and clever, and this makes conversation difficult, because,
taking us all round, we are neither sympathetic nor
clever&mdash;but this by the way.</p>
<p>Of course, I began to talk to her about her former
husband.&nbsp; I asked her how he was getting on.&nbsp; She
replied that she thought he was very comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married again?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serve him right,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;and his
wife too.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was a pretty, bright-eyed little
woman, my American friend, and I wished to ingratiate
myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;A woman who would marry such a man, knowing
what she must have known of him, is sure to make him wretched,
and we may trust him to be a curse to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend seemed inclined to defend him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is greatly improved,&rdquo; she argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;a man never
improves.&nbsp; Once a villain, always a villain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
call him that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard
you call him a villain yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was wrong of me,&rdquo; she said, flushing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he was not the only one to be blamed; we
were both foolish in those days, but I think we have both learned
a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remained silent, waiting for the necessary explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better come and see him for yourself,&rdquo;
she added, with a little laugh; &ldquo;to tell the truth, I am
the woman who has married him.&nbsp; Tuesday is my day, Number 2,
K&mdash; Mansions,&rdquo; and she ran off, leaving me staring
after her.</p>
<p>I believe an enterprising clergyman who would set up a little
church in the Strand, just outside the Law Courts, might do quite
a trade, re-marrying couples who had just been divorced.&nbsp; A
friend of mine, a respondent, told me he had never loved his wife
more than on two occasions&mdash;the first when she refused him,
the second when she came into the witness-box to give evidence
against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are curious creatures, you men,&rdquo; remarked a
lady once to another man in my presence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never
seem to know your own mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was feeling annoyed with men generally.&nbsp; I do not
blame her, I feel annoyed with them myself sometimes.&nbsp; There
is one man in particular I am always feeling intensely irritated
against.&nbsp; He says one thing, and acts another.&nbsp; He will
talk like a saint and behave like a fool, knows what is right and
does what is wrong.&nbsp; But we will not speak further of
him.&nbsp; He will be all he should be one day, and then we will
pack him into a nice, comfortably-lined box, and screw the lid
down tight upon him, and put him away in a quiet little spot near
a church I know of, lest he should get up and misbehave himself
again.</p>
<p>The other man, who is a wise man as men go, looked at his fair
critic with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;you are
blaming the wrong person.&nbsp; I confess I do not know my mind,
and what little I do know of it I do not like.&nbsp; I did not
make it, I did not select it.&nbsp; I am more dissatisfied with
it than you can possibly be.&nbsp; It is a greater mystery to me
than it is to you, and I have to live with it.&nbsp; You should
pity not blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are moods in which I fall to envying those old hermits
who frankly, and with courageous cowardice, shirked the problem
of life.&nbsp; There are days when I dream of an existence
unfettered by the thousand petty strings with which our souls lie
bound to Lilliputia land.&nbsp; I picture myself living in some
Norwegian sater, high above the black waters of a rockbound
fiord.&nbsp; No other human creature disputes with me my
kingdom.&nbsp; I am alone with the whispering fir forests and the
stars.&nbsp; How I live I am not quite sure.&nbsp; Once a month I
could journey down into the villages and return laden.&nbsp; I
should not need much.&nbsp; For the rest, my gun and fishing-rod
would supply me.&nbsp; I would have with me a couple of big dogs,
who would talk to me with their eyes, so full of dumb thought,
and together we would wander over the uplands, seeking our
dinner, after the old primitive fashion of the men who dreamt not
of ten-course dinners and Savoy suppers.&nbsp; I would cook the
food myself, and sit down to the meal with a bottle of good wine,
such as starts a man&rsquo;s thoughts (for I am inconsistent, as
I acknowledge, and that gift of civilization I would bear with me
into my hermitage).&nbsp; Then in the evening, with pipe in
mouth, beside my log-wood fire, I would sit and think, until new
knowledge came to me.&nbsp; Strengthened by those silent voices
that are drowned in the roar of Streetland, I might, perhaps,
grow into something nearer to what it was intended that a man
should be&mdash;might catch a glimpse, perhaps, of the meaning of
life.</p>
<p>No, no, my dear lady, into this life of renunciation I would
not take a companion, certainly not of the sex you are thinking
of, even would she care to come, which I doubt.&nbsp; There are
times when a man is better without the woman, when a woman is
better without the man.&nbsp; Love drags us from the depths,
makes men and women of us, but if we would climb a little nearer
to the stars we must say good-bye to it.&nbsp; We men and women
do not show ourselves to each other at our best; too often, I
fear, at our worst.&nbsp; The woman&rsquo;s highest ideal of man
is the lover; to a man the woman is always the possible
beloved.&nbsp; We see each other&rsquo;s hearts, but not each
other&rsquo;s souls.&nbsp; In each other&rsquo;s presence we
never shake ourselves free from the earth.&nbsp; Match-making
mother Nature is always at hand to prompt us.&nbsp; A woman lifts
us up into manhood, but there she would have us stay.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Climb up to me,&rdquo; she cries to the lad, walking with
soiled feet in muddy ways; &ldquo;be a true man that you may be
worthy to walk by my side; be brave to protect me, kind and
tender, and true; but climb no higher, stay here by my
side.&rdquo;&nbsp; The martyr, the prophet, the leader of the
world&rsquo;s forlorn hopes, she would wake from his dream.&nbsp;
Her arms she would fling about his neck holding him down.</p>
<p>To the woman the man says, &ldquo;You are my wife.&nbsp; Here
is your America, within these walls, here is your work, your
duty.&rdquo;&nbsp; True, in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases
out of every thousand, but men and women are not made in moulds,
and the world&rsquo;s work is various.&nbsp; Sometimes to her
sorrow, a woman&rsquo;s work lies beyond the home.&nbsp; The duty
of Mary was not to Joseph.</p>
<p>The hero in the popular novel is the young man who says,
&ldquo;I love you better than my soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our favourite
heroine in fiction is the woman who cries to her lover, &ldquo;I
would go down into Hell to be with you.&rdquo; There are men and
women who cannot answer thus&mdash;the men who dream dreams, the
women who see visions&mdash;impracticable people from the
Bayswater point of view.&nbsp; But Bayswater would not be the
abode of peace it is had it not been for such.</p>
<p>Have we not placed sexual love on a pedestal higher than it
deserves?&nbsp; It is a noble passion, but it is not the
noblest.&nbsp; There is a wider love by the side of which it is
but as the lamp illumining the cottage, to the moonlight bathing
the hills and valleys.&nbsp; There were two women once.&nbsp;
This is a play I saw acted in the daylight.&nbsp; They had been
friends from girlhood, till there came between them the usual
trouble&mdash;a man.&nbsp; A weak, pretty creature not worth a
thought from either of them; but women love the unworthy; there
would be no over-population problem did they not; and this poor
specimen, ill-luck had ordained they should contend for.</p>
<p>Their rivalry brought out all that was worst in both of
them.&nbsp; It is a mistake to suppose love only elevates; it can
debase.&nbsp; It was a mean struggle for what to an onlooker must
have appeared a remarkably unsatisfying prize.&nbsp; The loser
might well have left the conqueror to her poor triumph, even
granting it had been gained unfairly.&nbsp; But the old, ugly,
primeval passions had been stirred in these women, and the
wedding-bells closed only the first act.</p>
<p>The second is not difficult to guess.&nbsp; It would have
ended in the Divorce Court had not the deserted wife felt that a
finer revenge would be secured to her by silence.</p>
<p>In the third, after an interval of only eighteen months, the
man died&mdash;the first piece of good fortune that seems to have
occurred to him personally throughout the play.&nbsp; His
position must have been an exceedingly anxious one from the
beginning.&nbsp; Notwithstanding his flabbiness, one cannot but
regard him with a certain amount of pity&mdash;not unmixed with
amusement.&nbsp; Most of life&rsquo;s dramas can be viewed as
either farce or tragedy according to the whim of the
spectator.&nbsp; The actors invariably play them as tragedy; but
then that is the essence of good farce acting.</p>
<p>Thus was secured the triumph of legal virtue and the
punishment of irregularity, and the play might be dismissed as
uninterestingly orthodox were it not for the fourth act, showing
how the wronged wife came to the woman she had once wronged to
ask and grant forgiveness.&nbsp; Strangely as it may sound, they
found their love for one another unchanged.&nbsp; They had been
long parted: it was sweet to hold each other&rsquo;s hands
again.&nbsp; Two lonely women, they agreed to live
together.&nbsp; Those who knew them well in this later time say
that their life was very beautiful, filled with graciousness and
nobility.</p>
<p>I do not say that such a story could ever be common, but it is
more probable than the world might credit.&nbsp; Sometimes the
man is better without the woman, the woman without the man.</p>
<h2><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>ON
THE NOBILITY OF OURSELVES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old Anglicized Frenchman, I used
to meet often in my earlier journalistic days, held a theory,
concerning man&rsquo;s future state, that has since come to
afford me more food for reflection than, at the time, I should
have deemed possible.&nbsp; He was a bright-eyed, eager little
man.&nbsp; One felt no Lotus land could be Paradise to him.&nbsp;
We build our heaven of the stones of our desires: to the old,
red-bearded Norseman, a foe to fight and a cup to drain; to the
artistic Greek, a grove of animated statuary; to the Red Indian,
his happy hunting ground; to the Turk, his harem; to the Jew, his
New Jerusalem, paved with gold; to others, according to their
taste, limited by the range of their imagination.</p>
<p>Few things had more terrors for me, when a child, than
Heaven&mdash;as pictured for me by certain of the good folks
round about me.&nbsp; I was told that if I were a good lad, kept
my hair tidy, and did not tease the cat, I would probably, when I
died, go to a place where all day long I would sit still and sing
hymns.&nbsp; (Think of it! as reward to a healthy boy for being
good.)&nbsp; There would be no breakfast and no dinner, no tea
and no supper.&nbsp; One old lady cheered me a little with a hint
that the monotony might be broken by a little manna; but the idea
of everlasting manna palled upon me, and my suggestions,
concerning the possibilities of sherbet or jumbles, were scouted
as irreverent.&nbsp; There would be no school, but also there
would be no cricket and no rounders.&nbsp; I should feel no
desire, so I was assured, to do another angel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;dags&rdquo; by sliding down the heavenly banisters.&nbsp;
My only joy would be to sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we start singing the moment we get up in the
morning?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any morning,&rdquo; was the
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;There will be no day and no night.&nbsp; It
will all be one long day without end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall we always be singing?&rdquo; I persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will be so happy, you will always want to
sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I ever get tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you will never get tired, and you will never get
sleepy or hungry or thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does it go on like that for ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it go on for a million years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a million years, and then another million years,
and then another million years after that.&nbsp; There will never
be any end to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can remember to this day the agony of those nights, when I
would lie awake, thinking of this endless heaven, from which
there seemed to be no possible escape.&nbsp; For the other place
was equally eternal, or I might have been tempted to seek refuge
there.</p>
<p>We grown-up folk, our brains dulled by the slowly acquired
habit of not thinking, do wrong to torture children with these
awful themes.&nbsp; Eternity, Heaven, Hell are meaningless words
to us.&nbsp; We repeat them, as we gabble our prayers, telling
our smug, self-satisfied selves that we are miserable
sinners.&nbsp; But to the child, the &ldquo;intelligent
stranger&rdquo; in the land, seeking to know, they are fearful
realities.&nbsp; If you doubt me, Reader, stand by yourself,
beneath the stars, one night, and <i>solve</i> this thought,
Eternity.&nbsp; Your next address shall be the County Lunatic
Asylum.</p>
<p>My actively inclined French friend held cheerier views than
are common of man&rsquo;s life beyond the grave.&nbsp; His belief
was that we were destined to constant change, to everlasting
work.&nbsp; We were to pass through the older planets, to labour
in the greater suns.</p>
<p>But for such advanced career a more capable being was
needed.&nbsp; No one of us was sufficient, he argued, to be
granted a future existence all to himself.&nbsp; His idea was
that two or three or four of us, according to our intrinsic
value, would be combined to make a new and more important
individuality, fitted for a higher existence.&nbsp; Man, he
pointed out, was already a collection of the beasts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You and I,&rdquo; he would say, tapping first my chest and
then his own, &ldquo;we have them all here&mdash;the ape, the
tiger, the pig, the motherly hen, the gamecock, the good ant; we
are all, rolled into one.&nbsp; So the man of the future, he will
be made up of many men&mdash;the courage of one, the wisdom of
another, the kindliness of a third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a City man,&rdquo; he would continue, &ldquo;say
the Lord Mayor; add to him a poet, say Swinburne; mix them with a
religious enthusiast, say General Booth.&nbsp; There you will
have the man fit for the higher life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garibaldi and Bismarck, he held, should make a very fine
mixture, correcting one another; if needful, extract of Ibsen
might be added, as seasoning.&nbsp; He thought that Irish
politicians would mix admirably with Scotch divines; that Oxford
Dons would go well with lady novelists.&nbsp; He was convinced
that Count Tolstoi, a few Gaiety Johnnies (we called them
&ldquo;mashers&rdquo; in those days), together with a
humourist&mdash;he was kind enough to suggest myself&mdash;would
produce something very choice.&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth, he fancied,
was probably being reserved to go&mdash;let us hope in the long
distant future&mdash;with Ouida.&nbsp; It sounds a whimsical
theory, set down here in my words, not his; but the old fellow
was so much in earnest that few of us ever thought to laugh as he
talked.&nbsp; Indeed, there were moments on starry nights, as
walking home from the office, we would pause on Waterloo Bridge
to enjoy the witchery of the long line of the Embankment lights,
when I could almost believe, as I listened to him, in the not
impossibility of his dreams.</p>
<p>Even as regards this world, it would often be a gain, one
thinks, and no loss, if some half-dozen of us were rolled
together, or boiled down, or whatever the process necessary might
be, and something made out of us in that way.</p>
<p>Have not you, my fair Reader, sometimes thought to yourself
what a delightful husband Tom this, plus Harry that, plus Dick
the other, would make?&nbsp; Tom is always so cheerful and
good-tempered, yet you feel that in the serious moments of life
he would be lacking.&nbsp; A delightful hubby when you felt
merry, yes; but you would not go to him for comfort and strength
in your troubles, now would you?&nbsp; No, in your hour of
sorrow, how good it would be to have near you grave, earnest
Harry.&nbsp; He is a &ldquo;good sort,&rdquo; Harry.&nbsp;
Perhaps, after all, he is the best of the three&mdash;solid,
staunch, and true.&nbsp; What a pity he is just a trifle
commonplace and unambitious.&nbsp; Your friends, not knowing his
sterling hidden qualities, would hardly envy you; and a husband
that no other girl envies you&mdash;well, that would hardly be
satisfactory, would it?&nbsp; Dick, on the other hand, is clever
and brilliant.&nbsp; He will make his way; there will come a day,
you are convinced, when a woman will be proud to bear his
name.&nbsp; If only he were not so self-centred, if only he were
more sympathetic.</p>
<p>But a combination of the three, or rather of the best
qualities of the three&mdash;Tom&rsquo;s good temper,
Harry&rsquo;s tender strength, Dick&rsquo;s brilliant
masterfulness: that is the man who would be worthy of you.</p>
<p>The woman David Copperfield wanted was Agnes and Dora rolled
into one.&nbsp; He had to take them one after the other, which
was not so nice.&nbsp; And did he really love Agnes, Mr. Dickens;
or merely feel he ought to?&nbsp; Forgive me, but I am doubtful
concerning that second marriage of Copperfield&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Come, strictly between ourselves, Mr. Dickens, was not David,
good human soul! now and again a wee bit bored by the immaculate
Agnes?&nbsp; She made him an excellent wife, I am sure.&nbsp;
<i>She</i> never ordered oysters by the barrel, unopened.&nbsp;
It would, on any day, have been safe to ask Traddles home to
dinner; in fact, Sophie and the whole rose-garden might have
accompanied him, Agnes would have been equal to the
occasion.&nbsp; The dinner would have been perfectly cooked and
served, and Agnes&rsquo; sweet smile would have pervaded the
meal.&nbsp; But <i>after</i> the dinner, when David and Traddles
sat smoking alone, while from the drawing-room drifted down the
notes of high-class, elevating music, played by the saintly
Agnes, did they never, glancing covertly towards the empty chair
between them, see the laughing, curl-framed face of a very
foolish little woman&mdash;one of those foolish little women that
a wise man thanks God for making&mdash;and wish, in spite of all,
that it were flesh and blood, not shadow?</p>
<p>Oh, you foolish wise folk, who would remodel human
nature!&nbsp; Cannot you see how great is the work given unto
childish hands?&nbsp; Think you that in well-ordered housekeeping
and high-class conversation lies the whole making of a man?&nbsp;
Foolish Dora, fashioned by clever old magician Nature, who knows
that weakness and helplessness are as a talisman calling forth
strength and tenderness in man, trouble yourself not unduly about
those oysters nor the underdone mutton, little woman.&nbsp; Good
plain cooks at twenty pounds a year will see to these things for
us; and, now and then, when a windfall comes our way, we will
dine together at a moderate-priced restaurant where these things
are managed even better.&nbsp; Your work, Dear, is to teach us
gentleness and kindliness.&nbsp; Lay your curls here,
child.&nbsp; It is from such as you that we learn wisdom.&nbsp;
Foolish wise folk sneer at you; foolish wise folk would pull up
the useless lilies, the needless roses, from the garden, would
plant in their places only serviceable wholesome cabbage.&nbsp;
But the Gardener knowing better, plants the silly short-lived
flowers; foolish wise folk, asking for what purpose.</p>
<p>As for Agnes, Mr. Dickens, do you know what she always makes
me think of?&nbsp; You will not mind my saying?&mdash;the woman
one reads about.&nbsp; Frankly, I don&rsquo;t believe in
her.&nbsp; I do not refer to Agnes in particular, but the woman
of whom she is a type, the faultless woman we read of.&nbsp;
Women have many faults, but, thank God, they have one redeeming
virtue&mdash;they are none of them faultless.</p>
<p>But the heroine of fiction! oh, a terrible dragon of virtue is
she.&nbsp; May heaven preserve us poor men, undeserving though we
be, from a life with the heroine of fiction.&nbsp; She is all
soul, and heart, and intellect, with never a bit of human nature
to catch hold of her by.&nbsp; Her beauty, it appals one, it is
so painfully indescribable.&nbsp; Whence comes she, whither goes
she, why do we never meet her like?&nbsp; Of women I know a
goodish few, and I look among them for her prototype; but I find
it not.&nbsp; They are charming, they are beautiful, all these
women that I know.&nbsp; It would not be right for me to tell
you, Ladies, the esteem and veneration with which I regard you
all.&nbsp; You yourselves, blushing, would be the first to cheek
my ardour.&nbsp; But yet, dear Ladies, seen even through my eyes,
you come not near the ladies that I read about.&nbsp; You are
not&mdash;if I may be permitted an expressive vulgarism&mdash;in
the same street with them.&nbsp; Your beauty I can look upon, and
retain my reason&mdash;for whatever value that may be to
me.&nbsp; Your conversation, I admit, is clever and brilliant in
the extreme; your knowledge vast and various; your culture quite
Bostonian; yet you do not&mdash;I hardly know how to express
it&mdash;you do not shine with the sixteen full-moon-power of the
heroine of fiction.&nbsp; You do not&mdash;and I thank you for
it&mdash;impress me with the idea that you are the only women on
earth.&nbsp; You, even you, possess tempers of your own.&nbsp; I
am inclined to think you take an interest in your clothes.&nbsp;
I would not be sure, even, that you do not mingle a little of
&ldquo;your own hair&rdquo; (you know what I mean) with the hair
of your head.&nbsp; There is in your temperament a vein of
vanity, a suggestion of selfishness, a spice of laziness.&nbsp; I
have known you a trifle unreasonable, a little inconsiderate,
slightly exacting.&nbsp; Unlike the heroine of fiction, you have
a certain number of human appetites and instincts; a few human
follies, perhaps, a human fault, or shall we say two?&nbsp; In
short, dear Ladies, you also, even as we men, are the children of
Adam and Eve.&nbsp; Tell me, if you know, where I may meet with
this supernatural sister of yours, this woman that one reads
about.&nbsp; She never keeps any one waiting while she does her
back hair, she is never indignant with everybody else in the
house because she cannot find her own boots, she never scolds the
servants, she is never cross with the children, she never slams
the door, she is never jealous of her younger sister, she never
lingers at the gate with any cousin but the right one.</p>
<p>Dear me, where <i>do</i> they keep them, these women that one
reads about?&nbsp; I suppose where they keep the pretty girl of
Art.&nbsp; You have seen her, have you not, Reader, the pretty
girl in the picture?&nbsp; She leaps the six-barred gate with a
yard and a half to spare, turning round in her saddle the while
to make some smiling remark to the comic man behind, who, of
course, is standing on his head in the ditch.&nbsp; She floats
gracefully off Dieppe on stormy mornings.&nbsp; Her
<i>baigneuse</i>&mdash;generally of chiffon and old point
lace&mdash;has not lost a curve.&nbsp; The older ladies, bathing
round her, look wet.&nbsp; Their dress clings damply to their
limbs.&nbsp; But the pretty girl of Art dives, and never a curl
of her hair is disarranged.&nbsp; The pretty girl of Art stands
lightly on tip-toe and volleys a tennis-ball six feet above her
head.&nbsp; The pretty girl of Art keeps the head of the punt
straight against a stiff current and a strong wind.&nbsp;
<i>She</i> never gets the water up her sleeve, and down her back,
and all over the cushions.&nbsp; <i>Her</i> pole never sticks in
the mud, with the steam launch ten yards off and the man looking
the other way.&nbsp; The pretty girl of Art skates in high-heeled
French shoes at an angle of forty-five to the surface of the ice,
both hands in her muff.&nbsp; <i>She</i> never sits down plump,
with her feet a yard apart, and says &ldquo;Ough.&rdquo; The
pretty girl of Art drives tandem down Piccadilly, during the
height of the season, at eighteen miles an hour.&nbsp; It never
occurs to <i>her</i> leader that the time has now arrived for him
to turn round and get into the cart.&nbsp; The pretty girl of Art
rides her bicycle through the town on market day, carrying a
basket of eggs, and smiling right and left.&nbsp; <i>She</i>
never throws away both her handles and runs into a cow.&nbsp; The
pretty girl of Art goes trout fishing in open-work stockings,
under a blazing sun, with a bunch of dew-bespangled primroses in
her hair; and every time she gracefully flicks her rod she hauls
out a salmon.&nbsp; <i>She</i> never ties herself up to a tree,
or hooks the dog.&nbsp; <i>She</i> never comes home, soaked and
disagreeable, to tell you that she caught six, but put them all
back again, because they were merely two or three-pounders, and
not worth the trouble of carrying.&nbsp; The pretty girl of Art
plays croquet with one hand, and looks as if she enjoyed the
game.&nbsp; <i>She</i> never tries to accidentally kick her ball
into position when nobody is noticing, or stands it out that she
is through a hoop that she knows she isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>She is a good, all-round sportswoman, is the pretty girl in
the picture.&nbsp; The only thing I have to say against her is
that she makes one dissatisfied with the girl out of the
picture&mdash;the girl who mistakes a punt for a teetotum, so
that you land feeling as if you had had a day in the Bay of
Biscay; and who, every now and again, stuns you with the thick
end of the pole: the girl who does not skate with her hands in
her muff; but who, throwing them up to heaven, says,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; and who goes, taking care that you
go with her: the girl who, as you brush her down, and try to
comfort her, explains to you indignantly that the horse took the
corner too sharply and never noticed the mile-stone; the girl
whose hair sea water does <i>not</i> improve.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt about it: that is where they keep the
good woman of Fiction, where they keep the pretty girl of
Art.</p>
<p>Does it not occur to you, <i>Messieurs les Auteurs</i>, that
you are sadly disturbing us?&nbsp; These women that are a
combination of Venus, St. Cecilia, and Elizabeth Fry! you paint
them for us in your glowing pages: it is not kind of you,
knowing, as you must, the women we have to put up with.</p>
<p>Would we not be happier, we men and women, were we to idealize
one another less?&nbsp; My dear young lady, you have nothing
whatever to complain to Fate about, I assure you.&nbsp; Unclasp
those pretty hands of yours, and come away from the darkening
window.&nbsp; Jack is as good a fellow as you deserve;
don&rsquo;t yearn so much.&nbsp; Sir Galahad, my dear&mdash;Sir
Galahad rides and fights in the land that lies beyond the sunset,
far enough away from this noisy little earth where you and I
spend much of our time tittle-tattling, flirting, wearing fine
clothes, and going to shows.&nbsp; And besides, you must
remember, Sir Galahad was a bachelor: as an idealist he was
wise.&nbsp; Your Jack is by no means a bad sort of knight, as
knights go nowadays in this un-idyllic world.&nbsp; There is much
solid honesty about him, and he does not pose.&nbsp; He is not
exceptional, I grant you; but, my dear, have you ever tried the
exceptional man?&nbsp; Yes, he is very nice in a drawing-room,
and it is interesting to read about him in the Society papers:
you will find most of his good qualities <i>there</i>: take my
advice, don&rsquo;t look into him too closely.&nbsp; You be
content with Jack, and thank heaven he is no worse.&nbsp; We are
not saints, we men&mdash;none of us, and our beautiful thoughts,
I fear, we write in poetry not action.&nbsp; The White Knight, my
dear young lady, with his pure soul, his heroic heart, his
life&rsquo;s devotion to a noble endeavour, does not live down
here to any great extent.&nbsp; They have tried it, one or two of
them, and the world&mdash;you and I: the world is made up of you
and I&mdash;has generally starved, and hooted them.&nbsp; There
are not many of them left now: do you think you would care to be
the wife of one, supposing one were to be found for you?&nbsp;
Would you care to live with him in two furnished rooms in
Clerkenwell, die with him on a chair bedstead?&nbsp; A century
hence they will put up a statue to him, and you may be honoured
as the wife who shared with him his sufferings.&nbsp; Do you
think you are woman enough for that?&nbsp; If not, thank your
stars you have secured, for your own exclusive use, one of us
<i>un</i>exceptional men, who knows no better than to admire
you.&nbsp; <i>You</i> are not exceptional.</p>
<p>And in us ordinary men there is some good.&nbsp; It wants
finding, that is all.&nbsp; We are not so commonplace as you
think us.&nbsp; Even your Jack, fond of his dinner, his
conversation four-cornered by the Sporting Press&mdash;yes, I
agree he is not interesting, as he sits snoring in the
easy-chair; but, believe it or not, there are the makings of a
great hero in Jack, if Fate would but be kinder to him, and shake
him out of his ease.</p>
<p>Dr. Jekyll contained beneath his ample waist-coat not two
egos, but three&mdash;not only Hyde but another, a greater than
Jekyll&mdash;a man as near to the angels as Hyde was to the
demons.&nbsp; These well-fed City men, these Gaiety Johnnies,
these plough-boys, apothecaries, thieves! within each one lies
hidden the hero, did Fate, the sculptor, choose to use his
chisel.&nbsp; That little drab we have noticed now and then, our
way taking us often past the end of the court, there was nothing
by which to distinguish her.&nbsp; She was not over-clean, could
use coarse language on occasion&mdash;just the spawn of the
streets: take care lest the cloak of our child should brush
her.</p>
<p>One morning the district Coroner, not, generally speaking, a
poet himself, but an adept at discovering poetry buried under
unlikely rubbish-heaps, tells us more about her.&nbsp; She earned
six shillings a week, and upon it supported a bed-ridden mother
and three younger children.&nbsp; She was housewife, nurse,
mother, breadwinner, rolled into one.&nbsp; Yes, there are
heroines <i>out</i> of fiction.</p>
<p>So loutish Tom has won the Victoria Cross&mdash;dashed out
under a storm of bullets and rescued the riddled flag.&nbsp; Who
would have thought it of loutish Tom?&nbsp; The village alehouse
one always deemed the goal of his endeavours.&nbsp; Chance comes
to Tom and we find him out.&nbsp; To Harry the Fates were less
kind.&nbsp; A ne&rsquo;er-do-well was Harry&mdash;drank, knocked
his wife about, they say.&nbsp; Bury him, we are well rid of him,
he was good for nothing.&nbsp; Are we sure?</p>
<p>Let us acknowledge we are sinners.&nbsp; We know, those of us
who dare to examine ourselves, that we are capable of every
meanness, of every wrong under the sun.&nbsp; It is by the
accident of circumstance, aided by the helpful watchfulness of
the policeman, that our possibilities of crime are known only to
ourselves.&nbsp; But having acknowledged our evil, let us also
acknowledge that we are capable of greatness.&nbsp; The martyrs
who faced death and torture unflinchingly for conscience&rsquo;
sake, were men and women like ourselves.&nbsp; They had their
wrong side.&nbsp; Before the small trials of daily life they no
doubt fell as we fall.&nbsp; By no means were they the pick of
humanity.&nbsp; Thieves many of them had been, and murderers,
evil-livers, and evil-doers.&nbsp; But the nobility was there
also, lying dormant, and their day came.&nbsp; Among them must
have been men who had cheated their neighbours over the counter;
men who had been cruel to their wives and children; selfish,
scandal-mongering women.&nbsp; In easier times their virtue might
never have been known to any but their Maker.</p>
<p>In every age and in every period, when and where Fate has
called upon men and women to play the man, human nature has not
been found wanting.&nbsp; They were a poor lot, those French
aristocrats that the Terror seized: cowardly, selfish, greedy had
been their lives.&nbsp; Yet there must have been good, even in
them.&nbsp; When the little things that in their little lives
they had thought so great were swept away from them, when they
found themselves face to face with the realities; then even they
played the man.&nbsp; Poor shuffling Charles the First, crusted
over with weakness and folly, deep down in him at last we find
the great gentleman.</p>
<p>I like to hear stories of the littleness of great men.&nbsp; I
like to think that Shakespeare was fond of his glass.&nbsp; I
even cling to the tale of that disgraceful final orgie with
friend Ben Jonson.&nbsp; Possibly the story may not be true, but
I hope it was.&nbsp; I like to think of him as poacher, as
village ne&rsquo;er-do-well, denounced by the local
grammar-school master, preached at by the local J. P. of the
period.&nbsp; I like to reflect that Cromwell had a wart on his
nose; the thought makes me more contented with my own
features.&nbsp; I like to think that he put sweets upon the
chairs, to see finely-dressed ladies spoil their frocks; to tell
myself that he roared with laughter at the silly jest, like any
East End &rsquo;Arry with his Bank Holiday squirt of dirty
water.&nbsp; I like to read that Carlyle threw bacon at his wife
and occasionally made himself highly ridiculous over small
annoyances, that would have been smiled at by a man of
well-balanced mind.&nbsp; I think of the fifty foolish things a
week <i>I</i> do, and say to myself, &ldquo;I, too, am a literary
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I like to think that even Judas had his moments of nobility,
his good hours when he would willingly have laid down his life
for his Master.&nbsp; Perhaps even to him there came, before the
journey&rsquo;s end, the memory of a voice
saying&mdash;&ldquo;Thy sins be forgiven thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
must have been good, even in Judas.</p>
<p>Virtue lies like the gold in quartz, there is not very much of
it, and much pains has to be spent on the extracting of it.&nbsp;
But Nature seems to think it worth her while to fashion these
huge useless stones, if in them she may hide away her precious
metals.&nbsp; Perhaps, also, in human nature, she cares little
for the mass of dross, provided that by crushing and cleansing
she can extract from it a little gold, sufficient to repay her
for the labour of the world.&nbsp; We wonder why she troubles to
make the stone.&nbsp; Why cannot the gold lie in nuggets on the
surface?&nbsp; But her methods are secrets to us.&nbsp; Perchance
there is a reason for the quartz.&nbsp; Perchance there is a
reason for the evil and folly, through which run, unseen to the
careless eye, the tiny veins of virtue.</p>
<p>Aye, the stone predominates, but the gold is there.&nbsp; We
claim to have it valued.&nbsp; The evil that there is in man no
tongue can tell.&nbsp; We are vile among the vile, a little evil
people.&nbsp; But we are great.&nbsp; Pile up the bricks of our
sins till the tower knocks at Heaven&rsquo;s gate, calling for
vengeance, yet we are great&mdash;with a greatness and a virtue
that the untempted angels may not reach to.&nbsp; The written
history of the human race, it is one long record of cruelty, of
falsehood, of oppression.&nbsp; Think you the world would be
spinning round the sun unto this day, if that written record were
all?&nbsp; Sodom, God would have spared had there been found ten
righteous men within its walls.&nbsp; The world is saved by its
just men.&nbsp; History sees them not; she is but the newspaper,
a report of accidents.&nbsp; Judge you life by that?&nbsp; Then
you shall believe that the true Temple of Hymen is the Divorce
Court; that men are of two classes only, the thief and the
policeman; that all noble thought is but a politician&rsquo;s
catchword.&nbsp; History sees only the destroying conflagrations,
she takes no thought of the sweet fire-sides.&nbsp; History notes
the wrong; but the patient suffering, the heroic endeavour, that,
slowly and silently, as the soft processes of Nature re-clothing
with verdure the passion-wasted land, obliterate that wrong, she
has no eyes for.&nbsp; In the days of cruelty and
oppression&mdash;not altogether yet of the past, one
fears&mdash;must have lived gentle-hearted men and women, healing
with their help and sympathy the wounds that else the world had
died of.&nbsp; After the thief, riding with jingle of sword and
spur, comes, mounted on his ass, the good Samaritan.&nbsp; The
pyramid of the world&rsquo;s evil&mdash;God help us! it rises
high, shutting out almost the sun.&nbsp; But the record of
man&rsquo;s good deeds, it lies written in the laughter of the
children, in the light of lovers&rsquo; eyes, in the dreams of
the young men; it shall not be forgotten.&nbsp; The fires of
persecution served as torches to show Heaven the heroism that was
in man.&nbsp; From the soil of tyranny sprang self-sacrifice, and
daring for the Right.&nbsp; Cruelty! what is it but the vile
manure, making the ground ready for the flowers of tenderness and
pity?&nbsp; Hate and Anger shriek to one another across the ages,
but the voices of Love and Comfort are none the less existent
that they speak in whispers, lips to ear.</p>
<p>We have done wrong, oh, ye witnessing Heavens, but we have
done good.&nbsp; We claim justice.&nbsp; We have laid down our
lives for our friends: greater love hath no man than this.&nbsp;
We have fought for the Right.&nbsp; We have died for the
Truth&mdash;as the Truth seemed to us.&nbsp; We have done noble
deeds; we have lived noble lives; we have comforted the
sorrowful; we have succoured the weak.&nbsp; Failing, falling,
making in our blindness many a false step, yet we have
striven.&nbsp; For the sake of the army of just men and true, for
the sake of the myriads of patient, loving women, for the sake of
the pitiful and helpful, for the sake of the good that lies
hidden within us,&mdash;spare us, O Lord.</p>
<h2><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>ON
THE MOTHERLINESS OF MAN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was only a piece of broken
glass.&nbsp; From its shape and colour, I should say it had, in
its happier days, formed portion of a cheap scent-bottle.&nbsp;
Lying isolated on the grass, shone upon by the early morning sun,
it certainly appeared at its best.&nbsp; It attracted him.</p>
<p>He cocked his head, and looked at it with his right eye.&nbsp;
Then he hopped round to the other side, and looked at it with his
left eye.&nbsp; With either optic it seemed equally
desirable.</p>
<p>That he was an inexperienced young rook goes without
saying.&nbsp; An older bird would not have given a second glance
to the thing.&nbsp; Indeed, one would have thought his own
instinct might have told him that broken glass would be a mistake
in a bird&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; But its glitter drew him too
strongly for resistance.&nbsp; I am inclined to suspect that at
some time, during the growth of his family tree, there must have
occurred a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, perhaps worse.&nbsp;
Possibly a strain of magpie blood?&mdash;one knows the character
of magpies, or rather their lack of character&mdash;and such
things have happened.&nbsp; But I will not pursue further so
painful a train: I throw out the suggestion as a possible
explanation, that is all.</p>
<p>He hopped nearer.&nbsp; Was it a sweet illusion, this flashing
fragment of rainbow; a beautiful vision to fade upon approach,
typical of so much that is un-understandable in rook life?&nbsp;
He made a dart forward and tapped it with his beak.&nbsp; No, it
was real&mdash;as fine a lump of jagged green glass as any
newly-married rook could desire, and to be had for the
taking.&nbsp; <i>She</i> would be pleased with it.&nbsp; He was a
well-meaning bird; the mere upward inclination of his tail
suggested earnest though possibly ill-directed endeavour.</p>
<p>He turned it over.&nbsp; It was an awkward thing to carry; it
had so very many corners.&nbsp; But he succeeded at last in
getting it firmly between his beak, and in haste, lest some other
bird should seek to dispute with him its possession, at once flew
off with it.</p>
<p>A second rook who had been watching the proceedings from the
lime tree, called to a third who was passing.&nbsp; Even with my
limited knowledge of the language I found it easy to follow the
conversation: it was so obvious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Issachar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&nbsp; Zebulan&rsquo;s found a piece
of broken bottle.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to line his nest with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s truth.&nbsp; Look at him.&nbsp; There he
goes, he&rsquo;s got it in his beak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they both burst into a laugh.</p>
<p>But Zebulan heeded them not.&nbsp; If he overheard, he
probably put down the whole dialogue to jealousy.&nbsp; He made
straight for his tree.&nbsp; By standing with my left cheek
pressed close against the window-pane, I was able to follow
him.&nbsp; He is building in what we call the Paddock
elms&mdash;a suburb commenced only last season, but rapidly
growing.&nbsp; I wanted to see what his wife would say.</p>
<p>At first she said nothing.&nbsp; He laid it carefully down on
the branch near the half-finished nest, and she stretched up her
head and looked at it.</p>
<p>Then she looked at him.&nbsp; For about a minute neither
spoke.&nbsp; I could see that the situation was becoming
strained.&nbsp; When she did open her beak, it was with a subdued
tone, that had a vein of weariness running through it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He was evidently chilled by her manner.&nbsp; As I have
explained, he is an inexperienced young rook.&nbsp; This is
clearly his first wife, and he stands somewhat in awe of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t exactly know what it&rsquo;s
<i>called</i>,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s pretty, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
he added.&nbsp; He moved it, trying to get it where the sun might
reach it.&nbsp; It was evident he was admitting to himself that,
seen in the shade, it lost much of its charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; very pretty,&rdquo; was the rejoinder;
&ldquo;perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me what you&rsquo;re going to do
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question further discomforted him.&nbsp; It was growing
upon him that this thing was not going to be the success he had
anticipated.&nbsp; It would be necessary to proceed warily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s not a twig,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; You see, the nest is nearly all twigs as it
is, and I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear.&nbsp; I thought&mdash;unless you are of
opinion that it&rsquo;s too showy&mdash;I thought we might work
it in somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she flared out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you?&nbsp; You thought that a good idea.&nbsp;
An A1 prize idiot I seem to have married, I do.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve been gone twenty minutes, and you bring me back an
eight-cornered piece of broken glass, which you think we might
&lsquo;work into&rsquo; the nest.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d like to see
me sitting on it for a month, you would.&nbsp; You think it would
make a nice bed for the children to lie on.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
think you could manage to find a packet of mixed pins if you went
down again, I suppose.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d look pretty
&lsquo;worked in&rsquo; somewhere, don&rsquo;t you
think?&mdash;Here, get out of my way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll finish
this nest by myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; She always had been short with
him.</p>
<p>She caught up the offending object&mdash;it was a fairly heavy
lump of glass&mdash;and flung it out of the tree with all her
force.&nbsp; I heard it crash through the cucumber frame.&nbsp;
That makes the seventh pane of glass broken in that cucumber
frame this week.&nbsp; The couple in the branch above are the
worst.&nbsp; Their plan of building is the most extravagant, the
most absurd I ever heard of.&nbsp; They hoist up ten times as
much material as they can possibly use; you might think they were
going to build a block, and let it out in flats to the other
rooks.&nbsp; Then what they don&rsquo;t want they fling down
again.&nbsp; Suppose we built on such a principle?&nbsp; Suppose
a human husband and wife were to start erecting their house in
Piccadilly Circus, let us say; and suppose the man spent all the
day steadily carrying bricks up the ladder while his wife laid
them, never asking her how many she wanted, whether she
didn&rsquo;t think he had brought up sufficient, but just
accumulating bricks in a senseless fashion, bringing up every
brick he could find.&nbsp; And then suppose, when evening came,
and looking round, they found they had some twenty cart-loads of
bricks lying unused upon the scaffold, they were to commence
flinging them down into Waterloo Place.&nbsp; They would get
themselves into trouble; somebody would be sure to speak to them
about it.&nbsp; Yet that is precisely what those birds do, and
nobody says a word to them.&nbsp; They are supposed to have a
President.&nbsp; He lives by himself in the yew tree outside the
morning-room window.&nbsp; What I want to know is what he is
supposed to be good for.&nbsp; This is the sort of thing I want
him to look into.&nbsp; I would like him to be worming underneath
one evening when those two birds are tidying up: perhaps he would
do something then.&nbsp; I have done all I can.&nbsp; I have
thrown stones at them, that, in the course of nature, have
returned to earth again, breaking more glass.&nbsp; I have blazed
at them with a revolver; but they have come to regard this
proceeding as a mere expression of light-heartedness on my part,
possibly confusing me with the Arab of the Desert, who, I am
given to understand, expresses himself thus in moments of deep
emotion.&nbsp; They merely retire to a safe distance to watch me;
no doubt regarding me as a poor performer, inasmuch as I do not
also dance and shout between each shot.&nbsp; I have no objection
to their building there, if they only would build sensibly.&nbsp;
I want somebody to speak to them to whom they will pay
attention.</p>
<p>You can hear them in the evening, discussing the matter of
this surplus stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you work any more,&rdquo; he says, as he
comes up with the last load, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll tire
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am feeling a bit done up,&rdquo; she answers,
as she hops out of the nest and straightens her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit peckish, too, I expect,&rdquo; he
adds sympathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know I am.&nbsp; We will
have a scratch down, and be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about all this stuff?&rdquo; she asks, while
titivating herself; &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better not leave it about,
it looks so untidy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll soon get rid of that,&rdquo; he
answers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that down in a
jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To help him, she seizes a stick and is about to drop it.&nbsp;
He darts forward and snatches it from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you waste that one,&rdquo; he cries,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a rare one, that is.&nbsp; You see me hit the
old man with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he does.&nbsp; What the gardener says, I will leave you to
imagine.</p>
<p>Judged from its structure, the rook family is supposed to come
next in intelligence to man himself.&nbsp; Judging from the
intelligence displayed by members of certain human families with
whom I have come in contact, I can quite believe it.&nbsp; That
rooks talk I am positive.&nbsp; No one can spend half-an-hour
watching a rookery without being convinced of this.&nbsp; Whether
the talk be always wise and witty, I am not prepared to maintain;
but that there is a good deal of it is certain.&nbsp; A young
French gentleman of my acquaintance, who visited England to study
the language, told me that the impression made upon him by his
first social evening in London was that of a parrot-house.&nbsp;
Later on, when he came to comprehend, he, of course, recognized
the brilliancy and depth of the average London drawing-room talk;
but that is how, not comprehending, it impressed him at
first.&nbsp; Listening to the riot of a rookery is much the same
experience.&nbsp; The conversation to us sounds meaningless; the
rooks themselves would probably describe it as sparkling.</p>
<p>There is a Misanthrope I know who hardly ever goes into
Society.&nbsp; I argued the question with him one day.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I know, say, a
dozen men and women with whom intercourse is a pleasure; they
have ideas of their own which they are not afraid to voice.&nbsp;
To rub brains with such is a rare and goodly thing, and I thank
Heaven for their friendship; but they are sufficient for my
leisure.&nbsp; What more do I require?&nbsp; What is this
&lsquo;Society&rsquo; of which you all make so much ado?&nbsp; I
have sampled it, and I find it unsatisfying.&nbsp; Analyze it
into its elements, what is it?&nbsp; Some person I know very
slightly, who knows me very slightly, asks me to what you call an
&lsquo;At Home.&rsquo;&nbsp; The evening comes, I have done my
day&rsquo;s work and I have dined.&nbsp; I have been to a theatre
or concert, or I have spent a pleasant hour or so with a
friend.&nbsp; I am more inclined for bed than anything else, but
I pull myself together, dress, and drive to the house.&nbsp;
While I am taking off my hat and coat in the hall, a man enters I
met a few hours ago at the Club.&nbsp; He is a man I have very
little opinion of, and he, probably, takes a similar view of
me.&nbsp; Our minds have no thought in common, but as it is
necessary to talk, I tell him it is a warm evening.&nbsp; Perhaps
it is a warm evening, perhaps it isn&rsquo;t; in either case he
agrees with me.&nbsp; I ask him if he is going to Ascot.&nbsp; I
do not care a straw whether he is going to Ascot or not.&nbsp; He
says he is not quite sure, but asks me what chance Passion Flower
has for the Thousand Guineas.&nbsp; I know he doesn&rsquo;t value
my opinion on the subject at a brass farthing&mdash;he would be a
fool if he did, but I cudgel my brains to reply to him, as though
he were going to stake his shirt on my advice.&nbsp; We reach the
first floor, and are mutually glad to get rid of one
another.&nbsp; I catch my hostess&rsquo; eye.&nbsp; She looks
tired and worried; she would be happier in bed, only she
doesn&rsquo;t know it.&nbsp; She smiles sweetly, but it is clear
she has not the slightest idea who I am, and is waiting to catch
my name from the butler.&nbsp; I whisper it to him.&nbsp; Perhaps
he will get it right, perhaps he won&rsquo;t; it is quite
immaterial.&nbsp; They have asked two hundred and forty guests,
some seventy-five of whom they know by sight, for the rest, any
chance passer-by, able, as the theatrical advertisements say,
&lsquo;to dress and behave as a gentleman,&rsquo; would do every
bit as well.&nbsp; Indeed, I sometimes wonder why people go to
the trouble and expense of invitation cards at all.&nbsp; A
sandwich-man outside the door would answer the purpose.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lady Tompkins, At Home, this afternoon from three to
seven; Tea and Music.&nbsp; Ladies and Gentlemen admitted on
presentation of visiting card.&nbsp; Afternoon dress
indispensable.&rsquo;&nbsp; The crowd is the thing wanted; as for
the items, well, tell me, what is the difference, from the
Society point of view, between one man in a black frock-coat and
another?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember being once invited to a party at a house in
Lancaster Gate.&nbsp; I had met the woman at a picnic.&nbsp; In
the same green frock and parasol I might have recognized her the
next time I saw her.&nbsp; In any other clothes I did not expect
to.&nbsp; My cabman took me to the house opposite, where they
were also giving a party.&nbsp; It made no difference to any of
us.&nbsp; The hostess&mdash;I never learnt her name&mdash;said it
was very good of me to come, and then shunted me off on to a
Colonial Premier (I did not catch his name, and he did not catch
mine, which was not extraordinary, seeing that my hostess did not
know it) who, she whispered to me, had come over, from wherever
it was (she did not seem to be very sure) principally to make my
acquaintance.&nbsp; Half through the evening, and by accident, I
discovered my mistake, but judged it too late to say anything
then.&nbsp; I met a couple of people I knew, had a little supper
with them, and came away.&nbsp; The next afternoon I met my right
hostess&mdash;the lady who should have been my hostess.&nbsp; She
thanked me effusively for having sacrificed the previous evening
to her and her friends; she said she knew how seldom I went out:
that made her feel my kindness all the more.&nbsp; She told me
that the Brazilian Minister&rsquo;s wife had told her that I was
the cleverest man she had ever met.&nbsp; I often think I should
like to meet that man, whoever he may be, and thank him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps the butler does pronounce my name rightly,
and perhaps my hostess actually does recognize me.&nbsp; She
smiles, and says she was so afraid I was not coming.&nbsp; She
implies that all the other guests are but as a feather in her
scales of joy compared with myself.&nbsp; I smile in return,
wondering to myself how I look when I do smile.&nbsp; I have
never had the courage to face my own smile in the
looking-glass.&nbsp; I notice the Society smile of other men, and
it is not reassuring.&nbsp; I murmur something about my not
having been likely to forget this evening; in my turn, seeking to
imply that I have been looking forward to it for weeks.&nbsp; A
few men shine at this sort of thing, but they are a small
percentage, and without conceit I regard myself as no bigger a
fool than the average male.&nbsp; Not knowing what else to say, I
tell her also that it is a warm evening.&nbsp; She smiles archly
as though there were some hidden witticism in the remark, and I
drift away, feeling ashamed of myself.&nbsp; To talk as an idiot
when you <i>are</i> an idiot brings no discomfort; to behave as
an idiot when you have sufficient sense to know it, is
painful.&nbsp; I hide myself in the crowd, and perhaps I&rsquo;ll
meet a woman I was introduced to three weeks ago at a picture
gallery.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t know each other&rsquo;s names, but,
both of us feeling lonesome, we converse, as it is called.&nbsp;
If she be the ordinary type of woman, she asks me if I am going
on to the Johnsons&rsquo;.&nbsp; I tell her no.&nbsp; We stand
silent for a moment, both thinking what next to say.&nbsp; She
asks me if I was at the Thompsons&rsquo; the day before
yesterday.&nbsp; I again tell her no.&nbsp; I begin to feel
dissatisfied with myself that I was not at the
Thompsons&rsquo;.&nbsp; Trying to get even with her, I ask her if
she is going to the Browns&rsquo; next Monday.&nbsp; (There are
no Browns, she will have to say, No.)&nbsp; She is not, and her
tone suggests that a social stigma rests upon the Browns.&nbsp; I
ask her if she has been to Barnum&rsquo;s Circus; she
hasn&rsquo;t, but is going.&nbsp; I give her my impressions of
Barnum&rsquo;s Circus, which are precisely the impressions of
everybody else who has seen the show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or if luck be against me, she is possibly a smart
woman, that is to say, her conversation is a running fire of
spiteful remarks at the expense of every one she knows, and of
sneers at the expense of every one she doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I
always feel I could make a better woman myself, out of a bottle
of vinegar and a penn&rsquo;orth of mixed pins.&nbsp; Yet it
usually takes one about ten minutes to get away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even when, by chance, one meets a flesh-and-blood man
or woman at such gatherings, it is not the time or place for real
conversation; and as for the shadows, what person in their senses
would exhaust a single brain cell upon such?&nbsp; I remember a
discussion once concerning Tennyson, considered as a social
item.&nbsp; The dullest and most densely-stupid bore I ever came
across was telling how he had sat next to Tennyson at
dinner.&nbsp; &lsquo;I found him a most uninteresting man,&rsquo;
so he confided to us; &lsquo;he had nothing to say for
himself&mdash;absolutely nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; I should like to
resuscitate Dr. Samuel Johnson for an evening, and throw him into
one of these &lsquo;At Homes&rsquo; of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend is an admitted misanthrope, as I have explained; but
one cannot dismiss him as altogether unjust.&nbsp; That there is
a certain mystery about Society&rsquo;s craving for Society must
be admitted.&nbsp; I stood one evening trying to force my way
into the supper room of a house in Berkeley Square.&nbsp; A lady,
hot and weary, a few yards in front of me was struggling to the
same goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; remarked she to her companion, &ldquo;why
do we come to these places, and fight like a Bank Holiday crowd
for eighteenpenny-worth of food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come here,&rdquo; replied the man, whom I judged to
be a philosopher, &ldquo;to say we&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I met A&mdash; the other evening, and asked him to dine with
me on Monday.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why I ask A&mdash; to dine
with me, but about once a month I do.&nbsp; He is an
uninteresting man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
go to the B&mdash;s&rsquo;; confounded nuisance, it will be
infernally dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why go?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>A little later B&mdash; met me, and asked me to dine with him
on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;some friends
are coming to us that evening.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a duty dinner,
you know the sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could have managed it,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I shall have no one to talk to.&nbsp; The A&mdash;s are
coming, and they bore me to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask him?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>But to return to our rooks.&nbsp; We were speaking of their
social instincts.&nbsp; Some dozen of them&mdash;the
&ldquo;scallywags&rdquo; and bachelors of the community, I judge
them to be&mdash;have started a Club.&nbsp; For a month past I
have been trying to understand what the affair was.&nbsp; Now I
know: it is a Club.</p>
<p>And for their Club House they have chosen, of course, the tree
nearest my bedroom window.&nbsp; I can guess how that came about;
it was my own fault, I never thought of it.&nbsp; About two
months ago, a single rook&mdash;suffering from indigestion or an
unhappy marriage, I know not&mdash;chose this tree one night for
purposes of reflection.&nbsp; He woke me up: I felt angry.&nbsp;
I opened the window, and threw an empty soda-water bottle at
him.&nbsp; Of course it did not hit him, and finding nothing else
to throw, I shouted at him, thinking to frighten him away.&nbsp;
He took no notice, but went on talking to himself.&nbsp; I
shouted louder, and woke up my own dog.&nbsp; The dog barked
furiously, and woke up most things within a quarter of a
mile.&nbsp; I had to go down with a boot-jack&mdash;the only
thing I could find handy&mdash;to soothe the dog.&nbsp; Two hours
later I fell asleep from exhaustion.&nbsp; I left the rook still
cawing.</p>
<p>The next night he came again.&nbsp; I should say he was a bird
with a sense of humour.&nbsp; Thinking this might happen, I had,
however, taken the precaution to have a few stones ready.&nbsp; I
opened the window wide, and fired them one after another into the
tree.&nbsp; After I had closed the window, he hopped down nearer,
and cawed louder than ever.&nbsp; I think he wanted me to throw
more stones at him: he appeared to regard the whole proceeding as
a game.&nbsp; On the third night, as I heard nothing of him, I
flattered myself that, in spite of his bravado, I had discouraged
him.&nbsp; I might have known rooks better.</p>
<p>What happened when the Club was being formed, I take it, was
this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we fix upon for our Club House?&rdquo; said
the secretary, all other points having been disposed of.&nbsp;
One suggested this tree, another suggested that.&nbsp; Then up
spoke this particular rook:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you where,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in
the yew tree opposite the porch.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll tell you
for why.&nbsp; Just about an hour before dawn a man comes to the
window over the porch, dressed in the most comical costume you
ever set eyes upon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you what he reminds me
of&mdash;those little statues that men use for decorating
fields.&nbsp; He opens the window, and throws a lot of things out
upon the lawn, and then he dances and sings.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
awfully interesting, and you can see it all from the yew
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, I am convinced, is how the Club came to fix upon the
tree next my window.&nbsp; I have had the satisfaction of denying
them the exhibition they anticipated, and I cheer myself with the
hope that they have visited their disappointment upon their
misleader.</p>
<p>There is a difference between Rook Clubs and ours.&nbsp; In
our clubs the respectable members arrive early, and leave at a
reasonable hour; in Rook Clubs, it would appear, this principle
is reversed.&nbsp; The Mad Hatter would have liked this
Club&mdash;it would have been a club after his own heart.&nbsp;
It opens at half-past two in the morning, and the first to arrive
are the most disreputable members.&nbsp; In Rook-land the
rowdy-dowdy, randy-dandy, rollicky-ranky boys get up very early
in the morning and go to bed in the afternoon.&nbsp; Towards
dawn, the older, more orderly members drop in for reasonable
talk, and the Club becomes more respectable.&nbsp; The tree
closes about six.&nbsp; For the first two hours, however, the
goings-on are disgraceful.&nbsp; The proceedings, as often as
not, open with a fight.&nbsp; If no two gentlemen can be found to
oblige with a fight, the next noisiest thing to fall back upon is
held to be a song.&nbsp; It is no satisfaction to me to be told
that rooks cannot sing.&nbsp; <i>I</i> know that, without the
trouble of referring to the natural history book.&nbsp; It is the
rook who does not know it; <i>he</i> thinks he can; and as a
matter of fact, he does.&nbsp; You can criticize his singing, you
can call it what you like, but you can&rsquo;t stop it&mdash;at
least, that is my experience.&nbsp; The song selected is sure to
be one with a chorus.&nbsp; Towards the end it becomes mainly
chorus, unless the soloist be an extra powerful bird, determined
to insist upon his rights.</p>
<p>The President knows nothing of this Club.&nbsp; He gets up
himself about seven&mdash;three hours after all the others have
finished breakfast&mdash;and then fusses round under the
impression that he is waking up the colony, the fat-headed old
fool.&nbsp; He is the poorest thing in Presidents I have ever
heard of.&nbsp; A South American Republic would supply a better
article.&nbsp; The rooks themselves, the married majority,
fathers of families, respectable nestholders, are as indignant as
I am.&nbsp; I hear complaints from all quarters.</p>
<p>Reflection comes to one as, towards the close of these chill
afternoons in early spring, one leans upon the paddock gate
watching the noisy bustling in the bare elms.</p>
<p>So the earth is growing green again, and love is come again
unto the hearts of us old sober-coated fellows.&nbsp; Oh, Madam,
your feathers gleam wondrous black, and your bonnie bright eye
stabs deep.&nbsp; Come, sit by our side, and we&rsquo;ll tell you
a tale such as rook never told before.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the tale
of a nest in a topmost bough, that sways in the good west
wind.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s strong without, but it&rsquo;s soft
within, where the little green eggs lie safe.&nbsp; And there
sits in that nest a lady sweet, and she caws with joy, for, afar,
she sees the rook she loves the best.&nbsp; Oh, he has been east,
and he has been west, and his crop it is full of worms and slugs,
and they are all for her.</p>
<p>We are old, old rooks, so many of us.&nbsp; The white is
mingling with the purple black upon our breasts.&nbsp; We have
seen these tall elms grow from saplings; we have seen the old
trees fall and die.&nbsp; Yet each season come to us again the
young thoughts.&nbsp; So we mate and build and gather that again
our old, old hearts may quiver to the thin cry of our
newborn.</p>
<p>Mother Nature has but one care, the children.&nbsp; We talk of
Love as the Lord of Life: it is but the Minister.&nbsp; Our
novels end where Nature&rsquo;s tale begins.&nbsp; The drama that
our curtain falls upon, is but the prologue to her play.&nbsp;
How the ancient Dame must laugh as she listens to the prattle of
her children.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is Marriage a Failure?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is Life worth Living?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The New Woman
<i>versus</i> the Old.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, perhaps, the waves of the
Atlantic discuss vehemently whether they shall flow east or
west.</p>
<p>Motherhood is the law of the Universe.&nbsp; The whole duty of
man is to be a mother.&nbsp; We labour: to what end? the
children&mdash;the woman in the home, the man in the
community.&nbsp; The nation takes thought for its future:
why?&nbsp; In a few years its statesmen, its soldiers, its
merchants, its toilers, will be gathered unto their
fathers.&nbsp; Why trouble we ourselves about the future?&nbsp;
The country pours its blood and treasure into the earth that the
children may reap.&nbsp; Foolish Jacques Bonhomie, his addled
brain full of dreams, rushes with bloody hands to give his blood
for Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.&nbsp; He will not live to see,
except in vision, the new world he gives his bones to
build&mdash;even his spinning word-whipped head knows that.&nbsp;
But the children! they shall live sweeter lives.&nbsp; The
peasant leaves his fireside to die upon the battle-field.&nbsp;
What is it to him, a grain in the human sand, that Russia should
conquer the East, that Germany should be united, that the English
flag should wave above new lands? the heritage his fathers left
him shall be greater for his sons.&nbsp; Patriotism! what is it
but the mother instinct of a people?</p>
<p>Take it that the decree has gone forth from Heaven: There
shall be no more generations, with this life the world shall
die.&nbsp; Think you we should move another hand?&nbsp; The ships
would rot in the harbours, the grain would rot in the
ground.&nbsp; Should we paint pictures, write books, make music?
hemmed in by that onward creeping sea of silence.&nbsp; Think you
with what eyes husband and wife would look on one another.&nbsp;
Think you of the wooing&mdash;the spring of Love dried up; love
only a pool of stagnant water.</p>
<p>How little we seem to realize this foundation of our
life.&nbsp; Herein, if nowhere else, lies our eternity.&nbsp;
This Ego shall never die&mdash;unless the human race from
beginning to end be but a passing jest of the Gods, to be swept
aside when wearied of, leaving room for new experiments.&nbsp;
These features of mine&mdash;we will not discuss their
&aelig;sthetic value&mdash;shall never disappear; modified,
varied, but in essential the same, they shall continue in ever
increasing circles to the end of Time.&nbsp; This temperament of
mine&mdash;this good and evil that is in me, it shall grow with
every age, spreading ever wider, combining, amalgamating.&nbsp; I
go into my children and my children&rsquo;s children, I am
eternal.&nbsp; I am they, they are I.&nbsp; The tree withers and
you clear the ground, thankful if out of its dead limbs you can
make good firewood; but its spirit, its life, is in fifty
saplings.&nbsp; The tree dies not, it changes.</p>
<p>These men and women that pass me in the street, this one
hurrying to his office, this one to his club, another to his
love, they are the mothers of the world to come.</p>
<p>This greedy trickster in stocks and shares, he cheats, he
lies, he wrongs all men&mdash;for what?&nbsp; Follow him to his
luxurious home in the suburbs: what do you find?&nbsp; A man with
children on his knee, telling them stories, promising them
toys.&nbsp; His anxious, sordid life, for what object is it
lived?&nbsp; That these children may possess the things that he
thinks good for them.&nbsp; Our very vices, side by side with our
virtues, spring from this one root, Motherhood.&nbsp; It is the
one seed of the Universe.&nbsp; The planets are but children of
the sun, the moon but an offspring of the earth, stone of her
stone, iron of her iron.&nbsp; What is the Great Centre of us
all, life animate and inanimate&mdash;if any life <i>be</i>
inanimate?&nbsp; Is the eternal universe one dim figure,
Motherhood, filling all space?</p>
<p>This scheming Mother of Mayfair, angling for a rich
son-in-law!&nbsp; Not a pleasing portrait to look upon, from one
point of view.&nbsp; Let us look at it, for a moment, from
another.&nbsp; How weary she must be!&nbsp; This is her third
&ldquo;function&rdquo; to-night; the paint is running off her
poor face.&nbsp; She has been snubbed a dozen times by her social
superiors, openly insulted by a Duchess; yet she bears it with a
patient smile.&nbsp; It is a pitiful ambition, hers: it is that
her child shall marry money, shall have carriages and many
servants, live in Park Lane, wear diamonds, see her name in the
Society Papers.&nbsp; At whatever cost to herself, her daughter
shall, if possible, enjoy these things.&nbsp; She could so much
more comfortably go to bed, and leave the child to marry some
well-to-do commercial traveller.&nbsp; Justice, Reader, even for
such.&nbsp; Her sordid scheming is but the deformed child of
Motherhood.</p>
<p>Motherhood! it is the gamut of God&rsquo;s orchestra,
savageness and cruelty at the one end, tenderness and
self-sacrifice at the other.</p>
<p>The sparrow-hawk fights the hen: he seeking food for his
brood, she defending hers with her life.&nbsp; The spider sucks
the fly to feed its myriad young; the cat tortures the mouse to
give its still throbbing carcase to her kittens, and man wrongs
man for children&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Perhaps when the riot of the
world reaches us whole, not broken, we shall learn it is a
harmony, each jangling discord fallen into its place around the
central theme, Motherhood.</p>

THE INADVISABILITY OF FOLLOWING ADVICE</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> pacing the Euston platform
late one winter&rsquo;s night, waiting for the last train to
Watford, when I noticed a man cursing an automatic machine.&nbsp;
Twice he shook his fist at it.&nbsp; I expected every moment to
see him strike it.&nbsp; Naturally curious, I drew near
softly.&nbsp; I wanted to catch what he was saying.&nbsp;
However, he heard my approaching footsteps, and turned on
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you the man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who was
here just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just where?&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; I had been pacing
up and down the platform for about five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why here, where we are standing,&rdquo; he snapped
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where do you think &lsquo;here&rsquo;
is&mdash;over there?&rdquo;&nbsp; He seemed irritable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have passed this spot in the course of my
peregrinations, if that is what you mean,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
I spoke with studied politeness; my idea was to rebuke his
rudeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;are you the man that
spoke to me, just a minute ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not that man,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is not likely to forget talking to you,&rdquo; I
retorted.</p>
<p>His tone had been most offensive.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your
pardon,&rdquo; he replied grudgingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you
looked like the man who spoke to me a minute or so
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt mollified; he was the only other man on the platform,
and I had a quarter of an hour to wait.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, it
certainly wasn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; I returned genially, but
ungrammatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, did you want him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I put a
penny in the slot here,&rdquo; he continued, feeling apparently
the need of unburdening himself: &ldquo;wanted a box of
matches.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t get anything put, and I was
shaking the machine, and swearing at it, as one does, when there
came along a man, about your size, and&mdash;you&rsquo;re
<i>sure</i> it wasn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; I again ungrammatically replied;
&ldquo;I would tell you if it had been.&nbsp; What did he
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he saw what had happened, or guessed it.&nbsp; He
said, &lsquo;They are troublesome things, those machines; they
want understanding.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;They want taking
up and flinging into the sea, that&rsquo;s what they
want!&rsquo;&nbsp; I was feeling mad because I hadn&rsquo;t a
match about me, and I use a lot.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;They stick
sometimes; the thing to do is to put another penny in; the weight
of the first penny is not always sufficient.&nbsp; The second
penny loosens the drawer and tumbles out itself; so that you get
your purchase together with your first penny back again.&nbsp; I
have often succeeded that way.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, it seemed a
silly explanation, but he talked as if he had been weaned by an
automatic machine, and I was sawney enough to listen to
him.&nbsp; I dropped in what I thought was another penny.&nbsp; I
have just discovered it was a two-shilling piece.&nbsp; The fool
was right to a certain extent; I have got something out.&nbsp; I
have got this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held it towards me; I looked at it.&nbsp; It was a packet
of Everton toffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two and a penny,&rdquo; he remarked, bitterly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sell it for a third of what it cost
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have put your money into the wrong machine,&rdquo;
I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know that!&rdquo; he answered, a little
crossly, as it seemed to me&mdash;he was not a nice man: had
there been any one else to talk to I should have left him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t losing the money I mind so much; it&rsquo;s
getting this damn thing, that annoys me.&nbsp; If I could find
that idiot Id ram it down his throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We walked to the end of the platform, side by side, in
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are people like that,&rdquo; he broke out, as we
turned, &ldquo;people who will go about, giving advice.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be getting six months over one of them, I&rsquo;m
always afraid.&nbsp; I remember a pony I had once.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(I judged the man to be a small farmer; he talked in a wurzelly
tone.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if you understand what I mean, but
an atmosphere of wurzels was the thing that somehow he
suggested.)&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a thoroughbred Welsh pony, as
sound a little beast as ever stepped.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d had him out
to grass all the winter, and one day in the early spring I
thought I&rsquo;d take him for a run.&nbsp; I had to go to
Amersham on business.&nbsp; I put him into the cart, and drove
him across; it is just ten miles from my place.&nbsp; He was a
bit uppish, and had lathered himself pretty freely by the time we
reached the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man was at the door of the hotel.&nbsp; He says,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good pony of yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pretty middling,&rsquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t do to over-drive &rsquo;em,
when they&rsquo;re young,&rsquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I says, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s done ten miles, and
I&rsquo;ve done most of the pulling.&nbsp; I reckon I&rsquo;m a
jolly sight more exhausted than he is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went inside and did my business, and when I came out
the man was still there.&nbsp; &lsquo;Going back up the
hill?&rsquo; he says to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, I didn&rsquo;t cotton to him from the
beginning.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got to get the other
side of it,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and unless you know any patent
way of getting over a hill without going up it, I reckon I
am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says, &lsquo;You take my advice: give him a pint of
old ale before you start.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Old ale,&rsquo; I says; &lsquo;why he&rsquo;s a
teetotaler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never you mind that,&rsquo; he answers;
&lsquo;you give him a pint of old ale.&nbsp; I know these ponies;
he&rsquo;s a good &rsquo;un, but he ain&rsquo;t set.&nbsp; A pint
of old ale, and he&rsquo;ll take you up that hill like a cable
tramway, and not hurt himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is about this class of
man.&nbsp; One asks oneself afterwards why one didn&rsquo;t knock
his hat over his eyes and run his head into the nearest
horse-trough.&nbsp; But at the time one listens to them.&nbsp; I
got a pint of old ale in a hand-bowl, and brought it out.&nbsp;
About half-a-dozen chaps were standing round, and of course there
was a good deal of chaff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re starting him on the downward
course, Jim,&rsquo; says one of them.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll
take to gambling, rob a bank, and murder his mother.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s always the result of a glass of ale, &rsquo;cording
to the tracts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He won&rsquo;t drink it like that,&rsquo; says
another; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s as flat as ditch water.&nbsp; Put a
head on it for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t you got a cigar for him?&rsquo; says
a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A cup of coffee and a round of buttered toast
would do him a sight more good, a cold day like this,&rsquo; says
a fourth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d half a mind then to throw the stuff away, or
drink it myself; it seemed a piece of bally nonsense, giving good
ale to a four-year-old pony; but the moment the beggar smelt the
bowl he reached out his head, and lapped it up as though
he&rsquo;d been a Christian; and I jumped into the cart and
started off, amid cheers.&nbsp; We got up the hill pretty
steady.&nbsp; Then the liquor began to work into his head.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve taken home a drunken man more than once and
there&rsquo;s pleasanter jobs than that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen a
drunken woman, and they&rsquo;re worse.&nbsp; But a drunken Welsh
pony I never want to have anything more to do with so long as I
live.&nbsp; Having four legs he managed to hold himself up; but
as to guiding himself, he couldn&rsquo;t; and as for letting me
do it, he wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; First we were one side of the
road, and then we were the other.&nbsp; When we were not either
side, we were crossways in the middle.&nbsp; I heard a bicycle
bell behind me, but I dared not turn my head.&nbsp; All I could
do was to shout to the fellow to keep where he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to pass you,&rsquo; he sang out, so soon
as he was near enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t do it,&rsquo; I called
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How much of the road do <i>you</i> want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All of it and a bit over,&rsquo; I answered him,
&lsquo;for this job, and nothing in the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He followed me for half-a-mile, abusing me; and every
time he thought he saw a chance he tried to pass me.&nbsp; But
the pony was always a bit too smart for him.&nbsp; You might have
thought the brute was doing it on purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not fit to be driving,&rsquo; he
shouted.&nbsp; He was quite right; I wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I was
feeling just about dead beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think you are?&rsquo; he continued,
&lsquo;the charge of the Light Brigade?&rsquo;&nbsp; (He was a
common sort of fellow.)&nbsp; &lsquo;Who sent <i>you</i> home
with the washing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he was making me wild by this time.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of talking to me?&rsquo;&nbsp; I
shouted back.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come and blackguard the pony if you
want to blackguard anybody.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got all I can do
without the help of that alarm clock of yours.&nbsp; Go away,
you&rsquo;re only making him worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the pony?&rsquo; he
called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s drunk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course it sounded foolish; the truth often
does.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One of you&rsquo;s drunk,&rsquo; he retorted;
&lsquo;for two pins I&rsquo;d come and haul you out of the
cart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness he had; I&rsquo;d have given
something to be out of that cart.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t have
the chance.&nbsp; At that moment the pony gave a sudden swerve;
and I take it he must have been a bit too close.&nbsp; I heard a
yell and a curse, and at the same instant I was splashed from
head to foot with ditch water.&nbsp; Then the brute bolted.&nbsp;
A man was coming along, asleep on the top of a cart-load of
windsor chairs.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s disgraceful the way those
wagoners go to sleep; I wonder there are not more
accidents.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he ever knew what had
happened to him.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t look round to see what
became of him; I only saw him start.&nbsp; Half-way down the hill
a policeman holla&rsquo;d to me to stop.&nbsp; I heard him
shouting out something about furious driving.&nbsp; Half-a-mile
this side of Chesham we came upon a girls&rsquo; school walking
two and two&mdash;a &lsquo;crocodile&rsquo; they call it, I
think.&nbsp; I bet you those girls are still talking about
it.&nbsp; It must have taken the old woman a good hour to collect
them together again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was market-day in Chesham; and I guess there has not
been a busier market-day in Chesham before or since.&nbsp; We
went through the town at about thirty miles an hour.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve never seen Chesham so lively&mdash;it&rsquo;s a sleepy
hole as a rule.&nbsp; A mile outside the town I sighted the High
Wycombe coach.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t feel I minded much; I had got
to that pass when it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter to me what
happened; I only felt curious.&nbsp; A dozen yards off the coach
the pony stopped dead; that jerked me off the seat to the bottom
of the cart.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t get up, because the seat was
on top of me.&nbsp; I could see nothing but the sky, and
occasionally the head of the pony, when he stood upon his hind
legs.&nbsp; But I could hear what the driver of the coach said,
and I judged he was having trouble also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take that damn circus out of the road,&rsquo; he
shouted.&nbsp; If he&rsquo;d had any sense he&rsquo;d have seen
how helpless I was.&nbsp; I could hear his cattle plunging about;
they are like that, horses&mdash;if they see one fool, then they
all want to be fools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take it home, and tie it up to its organ,&rsquo;
shouted the guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then an old woman went into hysterics, and began
laughing like an hyena.&nbsp; That started the pony off again,
and, as far as I could calculate by watching the clouds, we did
about another four miles at the gallop.&nbsp; Then he thought
he&rsquo;d try to jump a gate, and finding, I suppose, that the
cart hampered him, he started kicking it to pieces.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d never have thought a cart could have been separated
into so many pieces, if I hadn&rsquo;t seen it done.&nbsp; When
he had got rid of everything but half a wheel and the splashboard
he bolted again.&nbsp; I remained behind with the other ruins,
and glad I was to get a little rest.&nbsp; He came back later in
the afternoon, and I was pleased to sell him the next week for a
five-pound-note: it cost me about another ten to repair
myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To this day I am chaffed about that pony, and the local
temperance society made a lecture out of me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what comes of following advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sympathized with him.&nbsp; I have suffered from advice
myself.&nbsp; I have a friend, a City man, whom I meet
occasionally.&nbsp; One of his most ardent passions in life is to
make my fortune.&nbsp; He button-holes me in Threadneedle
Street.&nbsp; &ldquo;The very man I wanted to see,&rdquo; he
says; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let you in for a good
thing.&nbsp; We are getting up a little syndicate.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He is for ever &ldquo;getting up&rdquo; a little syndicate, and
for every hundred pounds you put into it you take a thousand
out.&nbsp; Had I gone into all his little syndicates, I could
have been worth at the present moment, I reckon, two million five
hundred thousand pounds.&nbsp; But I have not gone into all his
little syndicates.&nbsp; I went into one, years ago, when I was
younger.&nbsp; I am still in it; my friend is confident that my
holding, later on, will yield me thousands.&nbsp; Being, however,
hard-up for ready money, I am willing to part with my share to
any deserving person at a genuine reduction, upon a cash
basis.&nbsp; Another friend of mine knows another man who is
&ldquo;in the know&rdquo; as regards racing matters.&nbsp; I
suppose most people possess a friend of this type.&nbsp; He is
generally very popular just before a race, and extremely
unpopular immediately afterwards.&nbsp; A third benefactor of
mine is an enthusiast upon the subject of diet.&nbsp; One day he
brought me something in a packet, and pressed it into my hand
with the air of a man who is relieving you of all your
troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it and see,&rdquo; he answered, in the tone of a
pantomime fairy.</p>
<p>I opened it and looked, but I was no wiser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tea,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I was wondering if it
could be snuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not exactly tea,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a sort of tea.&nbsp; You take one cup of
that&mdash;one cup, and you will never care for any other kind of
tea again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was quite right, I took one cup.&nbsp; After drinking it I
felt I didn&rsquo;t care for any other tea.&nbsp; I felt I
didn&rsquo;t care for anything, except to die quietly and
inoffensively.&nbsp; He called on me a week later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that tea I gave you?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distinctly,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
the taste of it in my mouth now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it upset you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It annoyed me at the time,&rdquo; I answered;
&ldquo;but that&rsquo;s all over now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed thoughtful.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were quite
correct,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;it <i>was</i> snuff, a very
special snuff, sent me all the way from India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I liked it,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stupid mistake of mine,&rdquo; he went
on&mdash;&ldquo;I must have mixed up the packets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, accidents will happen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
you won&rsquo;t make another mistake, I feel sure; so far as I am
concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can all give advice.&nbsp; I had the honour once of serving
an old gentleman whose profession it was to give legal advice,
and excellent legal advice he always gave.&nbsp; In common with
most men who know the law, he had little respect for it.&nbsp; I
have heard him say to a would-be litigant&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, if a villain stopped me in the street and
demanded of me my watch and chain, I should refuse to give it to
him.&nbsp; If he thereupon said, &lsquo;Then I shall take it from
you by brute force,&rsquo; I should, old as I am, I feel
convinced, reply to him, &lsquo;Come on.&rsquo;&nbsp; But if, on
the other hand, he were to say to me, &lsquo;Very well, then I
shall take proceedings against you in the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench to compel you to give it up to me,&rsquo; I should at once
take it from my pocket, press it into his hand, and beg of him to
say no more about the matter.&nbsp; And I should consider I was
getting off cheaply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet that same old gentleman went to law himself with his
next-door neighbour over a dead poll parrot that wasn&rsquo;t
worth sixpence to anybody, and spent from first to last a hundred
pounds, if he spent a penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a fool,&rdquo; he confessed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have no positive proof that it <i>was</i> his cat; but
I&rsquo;ll make him pay for calling me an Old Bailey Attorney,
hanged if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all know how the pudding <i>ought</i> to be made.&nbsp; We
do not profess to be able to make it: that is not our
business.&nbsp; Our business is to criticize the cook.&nbsp; It
seems our business to criticize so many things that it is not our
business to do.&nbsp; We are all critics nowadays.&nbsp; I have
my opinion of you, Reader, and you possibly have your own opinion
of me.&nbsp; I do not seek to know it; personally, I prefer the
man who says what he has to say of me behind my back.&nbsp; I
remember, when on a lecturing tour, the ground-plan of the hall
often necessitated my mingling with the audience as they streamed
out.&nbsp; This never happened but I would overhear somebody in
front of me whisper to his or her companion&mdash;&ldquo;Take
care, he&rsquo;s just behind you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I always felt so
grateful to that whisperer.</p>
<p>At a Bohemian Club, I was once drinking coffee with a
Novelist, who happened to be a broad-shouldered, athletic
man.&nbsp; A fellow-member, joining us, said to the Novelist,
&ldquo;I have just finished that last book of yours; I&rsquo;ll
tell you my candid opinion of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Promptly replied
the Novelist, &ldquo;I give you fair warning&mdash;if you do, I
shall punch your head.&rdquo;&nbsp; We never heard that candid
opinion.</p>
<p>Most of our leisure time we spend sneering at one
another.&nbsp; It is a wonder, going about as we do with our
noses so high in the air, we do not walk off this little round
world into space, all of us.&nbsp; The Masses sneer at the
Classes.&nbsp; The morals of the Classes are shocking.&nbsp; If
only the Classes would consent as a body to be taught behaviour
by a Committee of the Masses, how very much better it would be
for them.&nbsp; If only the Classes would neglect their own
interests and devote themselves to the welfare of the Masses, the
Masses would be more pleased with them.</p>
<p>The Classes sneer at the Masses.&nbsp; If only the Masses
would follow the advice given them by the Classes; if only they
would be thrifty on their ten shillings a week; if only they
would all be teetotalers, or drink old claret, which is not
intoxicating; if only all the girls would be domestic servants on
five pounds a year, and not waste their money on feathers; if
only the men would be content to work for fourteen hours a day,
and to sing in tune, &ldquo;God bless the Squire and his
relations,&rdquo; and would consent to be kept in their proper
stations, all things would go swimmingly&mdash;for the
Classes.</p>
<p>The New Woman pooh-poohs the Old; the Old Woman is indignant
with the New.&nbsp; The Chapel denounces the Stage; the Stage
ridicules Little Bethel; the Minor Poet sneers at the world; the
world laughs at the Minor Poet.</p>
<p>Man criticizes Woman.&nbsp; We are not altogether pleased with
woman.&nbsp; We discuss her shortcomings, we advise her for her
good.&nbsp; If only English wives would dress as French wives,
talk as American wives, cook as German wives! if only women would
be precisely what we want them to be&mdash;patient and
hard-working, brilliantly witty and exhaustively domestic,
bewitching, amenable, and less suspicious; how very much better
it would be for them&mdash;also for us.&nbsp; We work so hard to
teach them, but they will not listen.&nbsp; Instead of paying
attention to our wise counsel, the tiresome creatures are wasting
their time criticizing us.&nbsp; It is a popular game, this game
of school.&nbsp; All that is needful is a doorstep, a cane, and
six other children.&nbsp; The difficulty is the six other
children.&nbsp; Every child wants to be the schoolmaster; they
will keep jumping up, saying it is their turn.</p>
<p>Woman wants to take the stick now, and put man on the
doorstep.&nbsp; There are one or two things she has got to say to
him.&nbsp; He is not at all the man she approves of.&nbsp; He
must begin by getting rid of all his natural desires and
propensities; that done, she will take him in hand and make of
him&mdash;not a man, but something very much superior.</p>
<p>It would be the best of all possible worlds if everybody would
only follow our advice.&nbsp; I wonder, would Jerusalem have been
the cleanly city it is reported, if, instead of troubling himself
concerning his own twopenny-halfpenny doorstep, each citizen had
gone out into the road and given eloquent lectures to all the
other inhabitants on the subject of sanitation?</p>
<p>We have taken to criticizing the Creator Himself of
late.&nbsp; The world is wrong, we are wrong.&nbsp; If only He
had taken our advice, during those first six days!</p>
<p>Why do I seem to have been scooped out and filled up with
lead?&nbsp; Why do I hate the smell of bacon, and feel that
nobody cares for me?&nbsp; It is because champagne and lobsters
have been made wrong.</p>
<p>Why do Edwin and Angelina quarrel?&nbsp; It is because Edwin
has been given a fine, high-spirited nature that will not brook
contradiction; while Angelina, poor girl, has been cursed with
contradictory instincts.</p>
<p>Why is excellent Mr. Jones brought down next door to
beggary?&nbsp; Mr. Jones had an income of a thousand a year,
secured by the Funds.&nbsp; But there came along a wicked Company
promoter (why are wicked Company promoters permitted?) with a
prospectus, telling good Mr. Jones how to obtain a hundred per
cent. for his money by investing it in some scheme for the
swindling of Mr. Jones&rsquo;s fellow-citizens.</p>
<p>The scheme does not succeed; the people swindled turn out,
contrary to the promise of the prospectus, to be Mr. Jones and
his fellow-investors.&nbsp; Why does Heaven allow these
wrongs?</p>
<p>Why does Mrs. Brown leave her husband and children, to run off
with the New Doctor?&nbsp; It is because an ill-advised Creator
has given Mrs. Brown and the New Doctor unduly strong
emotions.&nbsp; Neither Mrs. Brown nor the New Doctor are to be
blamed.&nbsp; If any human being be answerable it is, probably,
Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s grandfather, or some early ancestor of the New
Doctor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We shall criticize Heaven when we get there.&nbsp; I doubt if
any of us will be pleased with the arrangements; we have grown so
exceedingly critical.</p>
<p>It was once said of a very superior young man that he seemed
to be under the impression that God Almighty had made the
universe chiefly to hear what he would say about it.&nbsp;
Consciously or unconsciously, most of us are of this way of
thinking.&nbsp; It is an age of mutual improvement
societies&mdash;a delightful idea, everybody&rsquo;s business
being to improve everybody else; of amateur parliaments, of
literary councils, of playgoers&rsquo; clubs.</p>
<p>First Night criticism seems to have died out of late, the
Student of the Drama having come to the conclusion, possibly,
that plays are not worth criticizing.&nbsp; But in my young days
we were very earnest at this work.&nbsp; We went to the play,
less with the selfish desire of enjoying our evening, than with
the noble aim of elevating the Stage.&nbsp; Maybe we did good,
maybe we were needed&mdash;let us think so.&nbsp; Certain it is,
many of the old absurdities have disappeared from the Theatre,
and our rough-and-ready criticism may have helped the happy
dispatch.&nbsp; A folly is often served by an unwise remedy.</p>
<p>The dramatist in those days had to reckon with his
audience.&nbsp; Gallery and Pit took an interest in his work such
as Galleries and Pits no longer take.&nbsp; I recollect
witnessing the production of a very blood-curdling melodrama at,
I think, the old Queen&rsquo;s Theatre.&nbsp; The heroine had
been given by the author a quite unnecessary amount of
conversation, so we considered.&nbsp; The woman, whenever she
appeared on the stage, talked by the yard; she could not do a
simple little thing like cursing the Villain under about twenty
lines.&nbsp; When the hero asked her if she loved him she stood
up and made a speech about it that lasted three minutes by the
watch.&nbsp; One dreaded to see her open her mouth.&nbsp; In the
Third Act, somebody got hold of her and shut her up in a
dungeon.&nbsp; He was not a nice man, speaking generally, but we
felt he was the man for the situation, and the house cheered him
to the echo.&nbsp; We flattered ourselves we had got rid of her
for the rest of the evening.&nbsp; Then some fool of a turnkey
came along, and she appealed to him, through the grating, to let
her out for a few minutes.&nbsp; The turnkey, a good but
soft-hearted man, hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it,&rdquo; shouted one earnest
Student of the Drama, from the Gallery; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s all
right.&nbsp; Keep her there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old idiot paid no attention to our advice; he argued the
matter to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but a trifling
request,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;and it will make her
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what about us?&rdquo; replied the same voice
from the Gallery.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know her.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve only just come on; we&rsquo;ve been listening to her
all the evening.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s quiet now, you let her
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let me out, if only for one moment!&rdquo; shrieked
the poor woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have something that I must say to
my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write it on a bit of paper, and pass it out,&rdquo;
suggested a voice from the Pit.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see that
he gets it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I keep a mother from her dying child?&rdquo;
mused the turnkey.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, it would be
inhuman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; persisted the voice of
the Pit; &ldquo;not in this instance.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too much
talk that has made the poor child ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The turnkey would not be guided by us.&nbsp; He opened the
cell door amidst the execrations of the whole house.&nbsp; She
talked to her child for about five minutes, at the end of which
time it died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he is dead!&rdquo; shrieked the distressed
parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky beggar!&rdquo; was the unsympathetic rejoinder of
the house.</p>
<p>Sometimes the criticism of the audience would take the form of
remarks, addressed by one gentleman to another.&nbsp; We had been
listening one night to a play in which action seemed to be
unnecessarily subordinated to dialogue, and somewhat poor
dialogue at that.&nbsp; Suddenly, across the wearying talk from
the stage, came the stentorian whisper&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake me up when the play begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was followed by an ostentatious sound as of
snoring.&nbsp; Then the voice of the second speaker was
heard&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sammy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His friend appeared to awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; Yes?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s up?&nbsp; Has
anything happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake you up at half-past eleven in any event, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, do, sonny.&rdquo; And the critic slept
again.</p>
<p>Yes, we took an interest in our plays then.&nbsp; I wonder
shall I ever enjoy the British Drama again as I enjoyed it in
those days?&nbsp; Shall I ever enjoy a supper again as I enjoyed
the tripe and onions washed down with bitter beer at the bar of
the old Albion?&nbsp; I have tried many suppers after the theatre
since then, and some, when friends have been in generous mood,
have been expensive and elaborate.&nbsp; The cook may have come
from Paris, his portrait may be in the illustrated papers, his
salary may be reckoned by hundreds; but there is something wrong
with his art, for all that, I miss a flavour in his meats.&nbsp;
There is a sauce lacking.</p>
<p>Nature has her coinage, and demands payment in her own
currency.&nbsp; At Nature&rsquo;s shop it is you yourself must
pay.&nbsp; Your unearned increment, your inherited fortune, your
luck, are not legal tenders across her counter.</p>
<p>You want a good appetite.&nbsp; Nature is quite willing to
supply you.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; she replies,
&ldquo;I can do you a very excellent article indeed.&nbsp; I have
here a real genuine hunger and thirst that will make your meal a
delight to you.&nbsp; You shall eat heartily and with zest, and
you shall rise from the table refreshed, invigorated, and
cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the very thing I want,&rdquo; exclaims the gourmet
delightedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me the price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price,&rdquo; answers Mrs. Nature, &ldquo;is one
long day&rsquo;s hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The customer&rsquo;s face falls; he handles nervously his
heavy purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot I pay for it in money?&rdquo; he asks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like work, but I am a rich man, I can afford
to keep French cooks, to purchase old wines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nature shakes her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot take your cheques, tissue and nerve are my
charges.&nbsp; For these I can give you an appetite that will
make a rump-steak and a tankard of ale more delicious to you than
any dinner that the greatest <i>chef</i> in Europe could put
before you.&nbsp; I can even promise you that a hunk of bread and
cheese shall be a banquet to you; but you must pay my price in my
money; I do not deal in yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And next the Dilettante enters, demanding a taste for Art and
Literature, and this also Nature is quite prepared to supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give you true delight in all these things,&rdquo;
she answers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Music shall be as wings to you, lifting
you above the turmoil of the world.&nbsp; Through Art you shall
catch a glimpse of Truth.&nbsp; Along the pleasant paths of
Literature you shall walk as beside still waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your charge?&rdquo; cries the delighted
customer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These things are somewhat expensive,&rdquo; replies
Nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want from you a life lived simply, free
from all desire of worldly success, a life from which passion has
been lived out; a life to which appetite has been
subdued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mistake, my dear lady,&rdquo; replies the
Dilettante; &ldquo;I have many friends, possessed of taste, and
they are men who do not pay this price for it.&nbsp; Their houses
are full of beautiful pictures, they rave about
&lsquo;nocturnes&rsquo; and &lsquo;symphonies,&rsquo; their
shelves are packed with first editions.&nbsp; Yet they are men of
luxury and wealth and fashion.&nbsp; They trouble much concerning
the making of money, and Society is their heaven.&nbsp; Cannot I
be as one of these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not deal in the tricks of apes,&rdquo; answers
Nature coldly; &ldquo;the culture of these friends of yours is a
mere pose, a fashion of the hour, their talk mere parrot
chatter.&nbsp; Yes, you can purchase such culture as this, and
pretty cheaply, but a passion for skittles would be of more
service to you, and bring you more genuine enjoyment.&nbsp; My
goods are of a different class.&nbsp; I fear we waste each
other&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And next comes the boy, asking with a blush for love, and
Nature&rsquo;s motherly old heart goes out to him, for it is an
article she loves to sell, and she loves those who come to
purchase it of her.&nbsp; So she leans across the counter,
smiling, and tells him that she has the very thing he wants, and
he, trembling with excitement, likewise asks the figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It costs a good deal,&rdquo; explains Nature, but in no
discouraging tone; &ldquo;it is the most expensive thing in all
my shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rich,&rdquo; replies the lad.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
father worked hard and saved, and he has left me all his
wealth.&nbsp; I have stocks and shares, and lands and factories;
and will pay any price in reason for this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nature, looking graver, lays her hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put by your purse, boy,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;my
price is not a price in reason, nor is gold the metal that I deal
in.&nbsp; There are many shops in various streets where your
bank-notes will be accepted.&nbsp; But if you will take an old
woman&rsquo;s advice, you will not go to them.&nbsp; The thing
they will sell you will bring sorrow and do evil to you.&nbsp; It
is cheap enough, but, like all things cheap, it is not worth the
buying.&nbsp; No man purchases it, only the fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the cost of the thing <i>you</i> sell
then?&rdquo; asks the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Self-forgetfulness, tenderness, strength,&rdquo;
answers the old Dame; &ldquo;the love of all things that are of
good repute, the hate of all things evil&mdash;courage, sympathy,
self-respect, these things purchase love.&nbsp; Put by your
purse, lad, it will serve you in other ways, but it will not buy
for you the goods upon my shelves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then am I no better off than the poor man?&rdquo;
demands the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not wealth or poverty as you understand
it,&rdquo; answers Nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I exchange realities
only for realities.&nbsp; You ask for my treasures, I ask for
your brain and heart in exchange&mdash;yours, boy, not your
father&rsquo;s, not another&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this price,&rdquo; he argues, &ldquo;how shall I
obtain it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go about the world,&rdquo; replies the great
Lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Labour, suffer, help.&nbsp; Come back to me
when you have earned your wages, and according to how much you
bring me so we will do business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is real wealth so unevenly distributed as we think?&nbsp; Is
not Fate the true Socialist?&nbsp; Who is the rich man, who the
poor?&nbsp; Do we know?&nbsp; Does even the man himself
know?&nbsp; Are we not striving for the shadow, missing the
substance?&nbsp; Take life at its highest; which was the happier
man, rich Solomon or poor Socrates?&nbsp; Solomon seems to have
had most things that most men most desire&mdash;maybe too much of
some for his own comfort.&nbsp; Socrates had little beyond what
he carried about with him, but that was a good deal.&nbsp;
According to our scales, Solomon should have been one of the
happiest men that ever lived, Socrates one of the most
wretched.&nbsp; But was it so?</p>
<p>Or taking life at its lowest, with pleasure its only
goal.&nbsp; Is my lord Tom Noddy, in the stalls, so very much
jollier than &rsquo;Arry in the gallery?&nbsp; Were beer ten
shillings the bottle, and champagne fourpence a quart, which,
think you, we should clamour for?&nbsp; If every West End Club
had its skittle alley, and billiards could only be played in East
End pubs, which game, my lord, would you select?&nbsp; Is the air
of Berkeley Square so much more joy-giving than the atmosphere of
Seven Dials?&nbsp; I find myself a piquancy in the air of Seven
Dials, missing from Berkeley Square.&nbsp; Is there so vast a
difference between horse-hair and straw, when you are
tired?&nbsp; Is happiness multiplied by the number of rooms in
one&rsquo;s house?&nbsp; Are Lady Ermintrude&rsquo;s lips so very
much sweeter than Sally&rsquo;s of the Alley?&nbsp; What
<i>is</i> success in life?</p>

THE PLAYING OF MARCHES AT THE FUNERALS OF MARIONETTES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> began the day badly.&nbsp; He
took me out and lost me.&nbsp; It would be so much better, would
he consent to the usual arrangement, and allow me to take him
out.&nbsp; I am far the abler leader: I say it without
conceit.&nbsp; I am older than he is, and I am less
excitable.&nbsp; I do not stop and talk with every person I meet,
and then forget where I am.&nbsp; I do less to distract myself: I
rarely fight, I never feel I want to run after cats, I take but
little pleasure in frightening children.&nbsp; I have nothing to
think about but the walk, and the getting home again.&nbsp; If,
as I say, he would give up taking me out, and let me take him
out, there would be less trouble all round.&nbsp; But into this I
have never been able to persuade him.</p>
<p>He had mislaid me once or twice, but in Sloane Square he lost
me entirely.&nbsp; When he loses me, he stands and barks for
me.&nbsp; If only he would remain where he first barked, I might
find my way to him; but, before I can cross the road, he is
barking half-way down the next street.&nbsp; I am not so young as
I was and I sometimes think he exercises me more than is good for
me.&nbsp; I could see him from where I was standing in the
King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; Evidently he was most indignant.&nbsp; I
was too far off to distinguish the barks, but I could guess what
he was saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn that man, he&rsquo;s off again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made inquiries of a passing dog&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t smelt my man about anywhere, have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(A dog, of course, would never speak of <i>seeing</i> anybody
or anything, smell being his leading sense.&nbsp; Reaching the
top of a hill, he would say to his companion&mdash;&ldquo;Lovely
smell from here, I always think; I could sit and sniff here all
the afternoon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or, proposing a walk, he would
say&mdash;&ldquo;I like the road by the canal, don&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something interesting to catch your nose
at every turn.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t smelt any man in particular,&rdquo;
answered the other dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;What sort of a smelling man
is yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an egg-and-bacony sort of a man, with a dash of
soap about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to go by,&rdquo; retorted the
other; &ldquo;most men would answer to that description, this
time of the morning.&nbsp; Where were you when you last noticed
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment he caught sight of me, and came up, pleased to
find me, but vexed with me for having got lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here you are,&rdquo; he barked; &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
you see me go round the corner?&nbsp; Do keep closer.&nbsp;
Bothered if half my time isn&rsquo;t taken up, finding you and
losing you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incident appeared to have made him bad-tempered; he was
just in the humour for a row of any sort.&nbsp; At the top of
Sloane Street a stout military-looking gentleman started running
after the Chelsea bus.&nbsp; With a &ldquo;Hooroo&rdquo; William
Smith was after him.&nbsp; Had the old gentleman taken no notice,
all would have been well.&nbsp; A butcher boy, driving just
behind, would&mdash;I could read it in his eye&mdash;have caught
Smith a flick as he darted into the road, which would have served
him right; the old gentleman would have captured his bus; and the
affair would have been ended.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he was that
type of retired military man all gout and curry and no
sense.&nbsp; He stopped to swear at the dog.&nbsp; That, of
course, was what Smith wanted.&nbsp; It is not often he gets a
scrimmage with a full-grown man.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a
poor-spirited lot, most of them,&rdquo; he thinks; &ldquo;they
won&rsquo;t even answer you back.&nbsp; I like a man who shows a
bit of pluck.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was frenzied with delight at his
success.&nbsp; He flew round his victim, weaving whooping circles
and curves that paralyzed the old gentleman as though they had
been the mystic figures of a Merlin.&nbsp; The colonel clubbed
his umbrella, and attempted to defend himself.&nbsp; I called to
the dog, I gave good advice to the colonel (I judged him to be a
colonel; the louder he spoke, the less one could understand him),
but both were too excited to listen to me.&nbsp; A sympathetic
bus driver leaned over, and whispered hoarse counsel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ketch &rsquo;im by the tail, sir,&rdquo; he advised the
old gentleman; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you be afraid of him; you ketch
&rsquo;im firmly by the tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A milkman, on the other hand, sought rather to encourage
Smith, shouting as he passed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good dog, kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A child, brained within an inch by the old gentleman&rsquo;s
umbrella, began to cry.&nbsp; The nurse told the old gentleman he
was a fool&mdash;a remark which struck me as singularly apt The
old gentleman gasped back that perambulators were illegal on the
pavement; and, between his exercises, inquired after
myself.&nbsp; A crowd began to collect; and a policeman strolled
up.</p>
<p>It was not the right thing: I do not defend myself; but, at
this point, the temptation came to me to desert William
Smith.&nbsp; He likes a street row, I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; These
things are matters of temperament.&nbsp; I have also noticed that
he has the happy instinct of knowing when to disappear from a
crisis, and the ability to do so; mysteriously turning up,
quarter of a mile off, clad in a peaceful and pre-occupied air,
and to all appearances another and a better dog.</p>
<p>Consoling myself with the reflection that I could be of no
practical assistance to him and remembering with some
satisfaction that, by a fortunate accident, he was without his
collar, which bears my name and address, I slipped round the off
side of a Vauxhall bus, making no attempt at ostentation, and
worked my way home through Lowndes Square and the Park.</p>
<p>Five minutes after I had sat down to lunch, he flung open the
dining-room door, and marched in.&nbsp; It is his customary
&ldquo;entrance.&rdquo; In a previous state of existence, his
soul was probably that of an Actor-Manager.</p>
<p>From his exuberant self-satisfaction, I was inclined to think
he must have succeeded in following the milkman&rsquo;s advice;
at all events, I have not seen the colonel since.&nbsp; His bad
temper had disappeared, but his &ldquo;uppishness&rdquo; had, if
possible, increased.&nbsp; Previous to his return, I had given
The O&rsquo;Shannon a biscuit.&nbsp; The O&rsquo;Shannon had been
insulted; he did not want a dog biscuit; if he could not have a
grilled kidney he did not want anything.&nbsp; He had thrown the
biscuit on the floor.&nbsp; Smith saw it and made for it.&nbsp;
Now Smith never eats biscuits.&nbsp; I give him one occasionally,
and he at once proceeds to hide it.&nbsp; He is a thrifty dog; he
thinks of the future.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never know what may
happen,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;suppose the Guv&rsquo;nor dies, or
goes mad, or bankrupt, I may be glad even of this biscuit;
I&rsquo;ll put it under the door-mat&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t,
somebody will find it there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll scratch a hole in
the tennis lawn, and bury it there.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a good
idea; perhaps it&rsquo;ll grow!&rdquo;&nbsp; Once I caught him
hiding it in my study, behind the shelf devoted to my own
books.&nbsp; It offended me, his doing that; the argument was so
palpable.&nbsp; Generally, wherever he hides it somebody finds
it.&nbsp; We find it under our pillows&mdash;inside our boots; no
place seems safe.&nbsp; This time he had said to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;By Jove! a whole row of the
Guv&rsquo;nor&rsquo;s books.&nbsp; Nobody will ever want to take
these out; I&rsquo;ll hide it here.&rdquo;&nbsp; One feels a
thing like that from one&rsquo;s own dog.</p>
<p>But The O&rsquo;Shannon&rsquo;s biscuit was another
matter.&nbsp; Honesty is the best policy; but dishonesty is the
better fun.&nbsp; He made a dash for it, and commenced to devour
it greedily; you might have thought he had not tasted food for a
week.</p>
<p>The indignation of The O&rsquo;Shannon was a sight for the
gods.&nbsp; He has the good-nature of his race: had Smith asked
him for the biscuit he would probably have given it to him; it
was the insult&mdash;the immorality of the proceeding, that
maddened The O&rsquo;Shannon.</p>
<p>For a moment he was paralyzed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the&mdash;&nbsp; Did ye see that
now?&rdquo; he said to me with his eyes.&nbsp; Then he made a
rush and snatched the biscuit out of Smith&rsquo;s very
jaws.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye onprincipled black Saxon thief,&rdquo;
growled The O&rsquo;Shannon; &ldquo;how dare ye take my
biscuit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You miserable Irish cur,&rdquo; growled Smith;
&ldquo;how was I to know it was your biscuit?&nbsp; Does
everything on the floor belong to you?&nbsp; Perhaps you think I
belong to you, I&rsquo;m on the floor.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe it is your biscuit, you long-eared, snubbed-nosed
bog-trotter; give it me back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t require any of your argument, you
flop-eared son of a tramp with half a tail,&rdquo; replied The
O&rsquo;Shannon.&nbsp; &ldquo;You come and take it, if you think
you are dog enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did think he was dog enough.&nbsp; He is half the size of
The O&rsquo;Shannon, but such considerations weigh not with
him.&nbsp; His argument is, if a dog is too big for you to fight
the whole of him, take a bit of him and fight that.&nbsp; He
generally gets licked, but what is left of him invariably
swaggers about afterwards under the impression it is the
victor.&nbsp; When he is dead, he will say to himself, as he
settles himself in his grave&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I flatter myself
I&rsquo;ve laid out that old world at last.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t
trouble <i>me</i> any more, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this occasion, <i>I</i> took a hand in the fight.&nbsp; It
becomes necessary at intervals to remind Master Smith that the
man, as the useful and faithful friend of dog, has his
rights.&nbsp; I deemed such interval had arrived.&nbsp; He flung
himself on to the sofa, muttering.&nbsp; It sounded
like&mdash;&ldquo;Wish I&rsquo;d never got up this morning.&nbsp;
Nobody understands me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing, however, sobers him for long.&nbsp; Half-an-hour
later, he was killing the next-door cat.&nbsp; He will never
learn sense; he has been killing that cat for the last three
months.&nbsp; Why the next morning his nose is invariably twice
its natural size, while for the next week he can see objects on
one side of his head only, he never seems to grasp; I suppose he
attributes it to change in the weather.</p>
<p>He ended up the afternoon with what he no doubt regarded as a
complete and satisfying success.&nbsp; Dorothea had invited a
lady to take tea with her that day.&nbsp; I heard the sound of
laughter, and, being near the nursery, I looked in to see what
was the joke.&nbsp; Smith was worrying a doll.&nbsp; I have
rarely seen a more worried-looking doll.&nbsp; Its head was off,
and its sawdust strewed the floor.&nbsp; Both the children were
crowing with delight; Dorothea, in particular, was in an ecstasy
of amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose doll is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eva&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered Dorothea, between her
peals of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; explained Eva, in a tone
of sweet content; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s my doll.&rdquo; She had
been sitting on it, and now drew it forth, warm but whole.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Dorry&rsquo;s doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The change from joy to grief on the part of Dorothea was
distinctly dramatic.&nbsp; Even Smith, accustomed to storm, was
nonplussed at the suddenness of the attack upon him.</p>
<p>Dorothea&rsquo;s sorrow lasted longer than I had
expected.&nbsp; I promised her another doll.&nbsp; But it seemed
she did not want another; that was the only doll she would ever
care for so long as life lasted; no other doll could ever take
its place; no other doll would be to her what that doll had
been.&nbsp; These little people are so absurd: as if it could
matter whether you loved one doll or another, when all are so
much alike!&nbsp; They have curly hair, and pink-and-white
complexions, big eyes that open and shut, a little red mouth, two
little hands.&nbsp; Yet these foolish little people! they will
love one, while another they will not look upon.&nbsp; I find the
best plan is not to reason with them, but to sympathize.&nbsp;
Later on&mdash;but not too soon&mdash;introduce to them another
doll.&nbsp; They will not care for it at first, but in time they
will come to take an interest in it.&nbsp; Of course, it cannot
make them forget the first doll; no doll ever born in Lowther
Arcadia could be as that, but still&mdash;&nbsp; It is many weeks
before they forget entirely the first love.</p>
<p>We buried Dolly in the country under the yew tree.&nbsp; A
friend of mine who plays the fiddle came down on purpose to
assist.&nbsp; We buried her in the hot spring sunshine, while the
birds from shady nooks sang joyously of life and love.&nbsp; And
our chief mourner cried real tears, just for all the world as
though it were not the fate of dolls, sooner or later, to get
broken&mdash;the little fragile things, made for an hour, to be
dressed and kissed; then, paintless and stript, to be thrown
aside on the nursery floor.&nbsp; Poor little dolls!&nbsp; I
wonder do they take themselves seriously, not knowing the springs
that stir their sawdust bosoms are but clockwork, not seeing the
wires to which they dance?&nbsp; Poor little marionettes! do they
talk together, I wonder, when the lights of the booth are
out?</p>
<p>You, little sister doll, were the heroine.&nbsp; You lived in
the white-washed cottage, all honeysuckle and clematis
without&mdash;earwiggy and damp within, maybe.&nbsp; How pretty
you always looked in your simple, neatly-fitting print
dress.&nbsp; How good you were!&nbsp; How nobly you bore your
poverty.&nbsp; How patient you were under your many wrongs.&nbsp;
You never harboured an evil thought, a revengeful
wish&mdash;never, little doll?&nbsp; Were there never moments
when you longed to play the wicked woman&rsquo;s part, live in a
room with many doors, be-clad in furs and jewels, with lovers
galore at your feet?&nbsp; In those long winter evenings? the
household work is done&mdash;the greasy dishes washed, the floor
scrubbed; the excellent child is asleep in the corner; the
one-and-elevenpenny lamp sheds its dismal light on the darned
table-cloth; you sit, busy at your coarse sewing, waiting for
Hero Dick, knowing&mdash;guessing, at least, where he
is&mdash;!&nbsp; Yes, dear, I remember your fine speeches, when
you told her, in stirring language the gallery cheered to the
echo, what you thought of her and of such women as she; when,
lifting your hand to heaven, you declared you were happier in
your attic, working your fingers to the bone, than she in her
gilded salon&mdash;I think &ldquo;gilded salon&rdquo; was the
term, was it not?&mdash;furnished by sin.&nbsp; But speaking of
yourself, weak little sister doll, not of your fine speeches, the
gallery listening, did you not, in your secret heart, envy
her?&nbsp; Did you never, before blowing out the one candle,
stand for a minute in front of the cracked glass, and think to
yourself that you, too, would look well in low-cut dresses from
Paris, the diamonds flashing on your white smooth skin?&nbsp; Did
you never, toiling home through the mud, bearing your bundle of
needlework, feel bitter with the wages of virtue, as she splashed
you, passing by in her carriage?&nbsp; Alone, over your cup of
weak tea, did you never feel tempted to pay the price for
champagne suppers, and gaiety, and admiration?&nbsp; Ah, yes, it
is easy for folks who have had their good time, to prepare
copybooks for weary little inkstained fingers, longing for
play.&nbsp; The fine maxims sound such cant when we are in that
mood, do they not?&nbsp; You, too, were young and handsome: did
the author of the play think you were never hungry for the good
things of life?&nbsp; Did he think that reading tracts to
crotchety old women was joy to a full-blooded girl in her
twenties?&nbsp; Why should <i>she</i> have all the love, and all
the laughter?&nbsp; How fortunate that the villain, the Wicked
Baronet, never opened the cottage door at that moment, eh,
dear!&nbsp; He always came when you were strong, when you felt
that you could denounce him, and scorn his temptations.&nbsp;
Would that the villain came to all of us at such time; then we
would all, perhaps, be heroes and heroines.</p>
<p>Ah well, it was only a play: it is over now.&nbsp; You and I,
little tired dolls, lying here side by side, waiting to know our
next part, we can look back and laugh.&nbsp; Where is she, this
wicked dolly, that made such a stir on our tiny stage?&nbsp; Ah,
here you are, Madam; I thought you could not be far; they have
thrown us all into this corner together.&nbsp; But how changed
you are, Dolly: your paint rubbed off, your golden hair worn to a
wisp.&nbsp; No wonder; it was a trying part you had to
play.&nbsp; How tired you must have grown of the glare and the
glitter!&nbsp; And even hope was denied you.&nbsp; The peace you
so longed for you knew you had lost the power to enjoy.&nbsp;
Like the girl bewitched in the fairy tale, you knew you must
dance ever faster and faster, with limbs growing palsied, with
face growing ashen, and hair growing grey, till Death should come
to release you; and your only prayer was he might come ere your
dancing grew comic.</p>
<p>Like the smell of the roses to Nancy, hawking them through the
hot streets, must the stifling atmosphere of love have been to
you.&nbsp; The song of passion, how monotonous in your ears, sung
now by the young and now by the old; now shouted, now whined, now
shrieked; but ever the one strident tune.&nbsp; Do you remember
when first you heard it?&nbsp; You dreamt it the morning hymn of
Heaven.&nbsp; You came to think it the dance music of Hell,
ground from a cracked hurdy-gurdy, lent out by the Devil on
hire.</p>
<p>An evil race we must have seemed to you, Dolly Faustine, as to
some Old Bailey lawyer.&nbsp; You saw but one side of us.&nbsp;
You lived in a world upside down, where the leaves and the
blossoms were hidden, and only the roots saw your day.&nbsp; You
imagined the worm-beslimed fibres the plant, and all things
beautiful you deemed cant.&nbsp; Chivalry, love, honour! how you
laughed at the lying words.&nbsp; You knew the truth&mdash;as you
thought: aye, half the truth.&nbsp; We were swine while your
spell was upon us, Daughter of Circe, and you, not knowing your
island secret, deemed it our natural shape.</p>
<p>No wonder, Dolly, your battered waxen face is stamped with an
angry sneer.&nbsp; The Hero, who eventually came into his estates
amid the plaudits of the Pit, while you were left to die in the
streets! you remembered, but the house had forgotten those
earlier scenes in always wicked Paris.&nbsp; The good friend of
the family, the breezy man of the world, the <i>Deus ex
Machina</i> of the play, who was so good to everybody, whom
everybody loved! aye, <i>you</i> loved him once&mdash;but that
was in the Prologue.&nbsp; In the Play proper, he was
respectable.&nbsp; (How you loathed that word, that meant to you
all you vainly longed for!)&nbsp; To him the Prologue was a
period past and dead; a memory, giving flavour to his life.&nbsp;
To you, it was the First Act of the Play, shaping all the
others.&nbsp; His sins the house had forgotten: at yours, they
held up their hands in horror.&nbsp; No wonder the sneer lies on
your waxen lips.</p>
<p>Never mind, Dolly; it was a stupid house.&nbsp; Next time,
perhaps, you will play a better part; and then they will cheer,
instead of hissing you.&nbsp; You were wasted, I am inclined to
think, on modern comedy.&nbsp; You should have been cast for the
heroine of some old-world tragedy.&nbsp; The strength of
character, the courage, the power of self-forgetfulness, the
enthusiasm were yours: it was the part that was lacking.&nbsp;
You might have worn the mantle of a Judith, a Boadicea, or a
Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, had such plays been popular in your
time.&nbsp; Perhaps they, had they played in your day, might have
had to be content with such a part as yours.&nbsp; They could not
have played the meek heroine, and what else would there have been
for them in modern drama?&nbsp; Catherine of Russia! had she been
a waiter&rsquo;s daughter in the days of the Second Empire,
should we have called her Great?&nbsp; The Magdalene! had her
lodging in those days been in some bye-street of Rome instead of
in Jerusalem, should we mention her name in our churches?</p>
<p>You were necessary, you see, Dolly, to the piece.&nbsp; We
cannot all play heroes and heroines.&nbsp; There must be wicked
people in the play, or it would not interest.&nbsp; Think of it,
Dolly, a play where all the women were virtuous, all the men
honest!&nbsp; We might close the booth; the world would be as
dull as an oyster-bed.&nbsp; Without you wicked folk there would
be no good.&nbsp; How should we have known and honoured the
heroine&rsquo;s worth, but by contrast with your
worthlessness?&nbsp; Where would have been her fine speeches, but
for you to listen to them?&nbsp; Where lay the hero&rsquo;s
strength, but in resisting temptation of you?&nbsp; Had not you
and the Wicked Baronet between you robbed him of his estates,
falsely accused him of crime, he would have lived to the end of
the play an idle, unheroic, incomplete existence.&nbsp; You
brought him down to poverty; you made him earn his own
bread&mdash;a most excellent thing for him; gave him the
opportunity to play the man.&nbsp; But for your conduct in the
Prologue, of what value would have been that fine scene at the
end of the Third Act, that stirred the house to tears and
laughter?&nbsp; You and your accomplice, the Wicked Baronet, made
the play possible.&nbsp; How would Pit and Gallery have known
they were virtuous, but for the indignation that came to them,
watching your misdeeds?&nbsp; Pity, sympathy, excitement, all
that goes to the making of a play, you were necessary for.&nbsp;
It was ungrateful of the house to hiss you.</p>
<p>And you, Mr. Merryman, the painted grin worn from your pale
lips, you too were dissatisfied, if I remember rightly, with your
part.&nbsp; You wanted to make the people cry, not laugh.&nbsp;
Was it a higher ambition?&nbsp; The poor tired people! so much
happens in their life to make them weep, is it not good sport to
make them merry for awhile?&nbsp; Do you remember that old soul
in the front row of the Pit?&nbsp; How she laughed when you sat
down on the pie!&nbsp; I thought she would have to be carried
out.&nbsp; I heard her talking to her companion as they passed
the stage-door on their way home.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not
laughed, my dear, till to-night,&rdquo; she was saying, the good,
gay tears still in her eyes, &ldquo;since the day poor Sally
died.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was not that alone worth the old stale tricks
you so hated?&nbsp; Aye, they were commonplace and conventional,
those antics of yours that made us laugh; are not the antics that
make us weep commonplace and conventional also?&nbsp; Are not all
the plays, played since the booth was opened, but of one pattern,
the plot old-fashioned now, the scenes now commonplace?&nbsp;
Hero, villain, cynic&mdash;are their parts so much the
fresher?&nbsp; The love duets, are they so very new?&nbsp; The
death-bed scenes, would you call them <i>un</i>commonplace?&nbsp;
Hate, and Evil, and Wrong&mdash;are <i>their</i> voices new to
the booth?&nbsp; What are you waiting for, people? a play with a
plot that is novel, with characters that have never strutted
before?&nbsp; It will be ready for you, perhaps, when you are
ready for it, with new tears and new laughter.</p>
<p>You, Mr. Merryman, were the true philosopher.&nbsp; You saved
us from forgetting the reality when the fiction grew somewhat
strenuous.&nbsp; How we all applauded your gag in answer to the
hero, when, bewailing his sad fate, he demanded of Heaven how
much longer he was to suffer evil fortune.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
there cannot be much more of it in store for you,&rdquo; you
answered him; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nearly nine o&rsquo;clock
already, and the show closes at ten.&rdquo;&nbsp; And true to
your prophecy the curtain fell at the time appointed, and his
troubles were of the past.&nbsp; You showed us the truth behind
the mask.&nbsp; When pompous Lord Shallow, in ermine and wig,
went to take his seat amid the fawning crowd, you pulled the
chair from under him, and down he sat plump on the floor.&nbsp;
His robe flew open, his wig flew off.&nbsp; No longer he awed
us.&nbsp; His aped dignity fell from him; we saw him a
stupid-eyed, bald little man; he imposed no longer upon us.&nbsp;
It is your fool who is the only true wise man.</p>
<p>Yours was the best part in the play, Brother Merryman, had you
and the audience but known it.&nbsp; But you dreamt of a showier
part, where you loved and fought.&nbsp; I have heard you now and
again, when you did not know I was near, shouting with sword in
hand before your looking-glass.&nbsp; You had thrown your motley
aside to don a dingy red coat; you were the hero of the play, you
performed the gallant deeds, you made the noble speeches.&nbsp; I
wonder what the play would be like, were we all to write our own
parts.&nbsp; There would be no clowns, no singing
chambermaids.&nbsp; We would all be playing lead in the centre of
the stage, with the lime-light exclusively devoted to
ourselves.&nbsp; Would it not be so?</p>
<p>What grand acting parts they are, these characters we write
for ourselves alone in our dressing-rooms.&nbsp; We are always
brave and noble&mdash;wicked sometimes, but if so, in a great,
high-minded way; never in a mean or little way.&nbsp; What
wondrous deeds we do, while the house looks on and marvels.&nbsp;
Now we are soldiers, leading armies to victory.&nbsp; What if we
die: it is in the hour of triumph, and a nation is left to
mourn.&nbsp; Not in some forgotten skirmish do we ever fall; not
for some &ldquo;affair of outposts&rdquo; do we give our blood,
our very name unmentioned in the dispatches home.&nbsp; Now we
are passionate lovers, well losing a world for love&mdash;a very
different thing to being a laughter-provoking co-respondent in a
sordid divorce case.</p>
<p>And the house is always crowded when we play.&nbsp; Our fine
speeches always fall on sympathetic ears, our brave deeds are
noted and applauded.&nbsp; It is so different in the real
performance.&nbsp; So often we play our parts to empty benches,
or if a thin house be present, they misunderstand, and laugh at
the pathetic passages.&nbsp; And when our finest opportunity
comes, the royal box, in which <i>he</i> or <i>she</i> should be
present to watch us, is vacant.</p>
<p>Poor little dolls, how seriously we take ourselves, not
knowing the springs that stir our bosoms are but clockwork, not
seeing the wires to which we dance.&nbsp; Poor little
marionettes, shall we talk together, I wonder, when the lights of
the booth are out?</p>
<p>We are little wax dollies with hearts.&nbsp; We are little tin
soldiers with souls.&nbsp; Oh, King of many toys, are you merely
playing with us?&nbsp; <i>Is</i> it only clockwork within us,
this thing that throbs and aches?&nbsp; Have you wound us up but
to let us run down?&nbsp; Will you wind us again to-morrow, or
leave us here to rust?&nbsp; <i>Is</i> it only clockwork to which
we respond and quiver?&nbsp; Now we laugh, now we cry, now we
dance; our little arms go out to clasp one another, our little
lips kiss, then say good-bye.&nbsp; We strive, and we strain, and
we struggle.&nbsp; We reach now for gold, now for laurel.&nbsp;
We call it desire and ambition: are they only wires that you
play?&nbsp; Will you throw the clockwork aside, or use it again,
O Master?</p>
<p>The lights of the booth grow dim.&nbsp; The springs are broken
that kept our eyes awake.&nbsp; The wire that held us erect is
snapped, and helpless we fall in a heap on the stage.&nbsp; Oh,
brother and sister dollies we played beside, where are you?&nbsp;
Why is it so dark and silent?&nbsp; Why are we being put into
this black box?&nbsp; And hark! the little doll
orchestra&mdash;how far away the music sounds! what is it they
are playing:&mdash;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
